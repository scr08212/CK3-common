Traits represent a character's personality, abilities, reputation, and physical characteristics. They can be gained or lost through events and some traits can be inherited by descendants. Traits affect everything about a character, from attributes to the opinion others have on them. Most traits influence the outcome of certain events or grant additional options. When using the [[Ruler Designer]], most traits have a cost in customization points.

== Personality traits ==
Personality traits are the traits that represent a character the most and impact if and how much {{iconify|Stress}} a character receives for actions and decisions that conflict with these traits. For AI characters, it also determines [[Character#AI Personality|their behavior]] (e.g. how resistant they are to another character's {{iconify|Dread}}). Characters tend not to have more than 3 personality traits. While personality traits can change, it is very difficult to do so; this most often occurs as the result of a mental break at Stress Level 2 or higher.

Personality traits are most malleable during childhood, where they will gain an event to gain a personality trait at ages of 9, 11 and 13. If the player is playing as the child, they could choose to gain one of 3 possible traits. Otherwise, if the player is the guardian of a child, they can choose to go with child's acquired personality, or change it at a cost of stress. Children are more likely to gain the personality trait of their guardian, and less likely to gain the opposite of it. Certain [[Traditions]] make certain personalities more prevalent.

Each personality trait has one or two opposite traits and usually characters with opposite personality traits will have lowered {{iconify|Opinion}} of each other. Additionally, characters with same or similar traits will typically be easier to Befriend, Seduce and Romance, while harder for those with opposite or contrasting traits. A character cannot have two opposing traits, or three mutually exclusive traits. Personality traits are listed with opposite traits on the same row.

On Steam, if Stream Rich Presence is enabled one of the personality traits will be referenced while the user is playing.

== Education traits ==
When reaching adulthood every character receives an education trait based on how their education focus went and can be upgraded by completing [[File:Activity adult education.png|24px]] University Visit activities. Education traits grant a bonus to one skill as well as to the monthly experience gained in the Lifestyle associated with the trait. There are three exceptions:
* {{iconify|Prowess}} traits can be obtained together with a {{iconify|Martial}} education one if either the child or its guardian's culture that has the [[Innovation#High_Medieval_innovations|Knighthood]] innovation and a Martial Custom cultural pillar matching the child's gender.
* {{icon|stewardship}}{{icon|learning}} Stewardship-Learning traits can be obtained if the child's dynasty has the second [[File:Urbanism legacy track.png|24px]] Metropolitan legacy unlocked. The chance to gain a trait are equal to the {{iconify|Development}} level of their guardian's liege's capital and higher {{iconify|Development}} also increases the chance of gaining a better trait.
* Level 5 traits can be obtained if the child's dynasty finished the [[File:Legitimacy legacy track.png|24px]] Legitimacy dynasty legacy or the estate has the Education Hall upgrade.

Congenital traits have a very small chance to appear upon birth and can be inherited by a character's descendants, especially if both parents have the same trait or are related. Congenital traits are marked with a white aura.

=== Leveled congenital traits ===
The following Congenital traits come in multiple levels. A leveled Congenital trait has a 50% chance to increase in level if both parents have the same trait, both positively and negatively. 

The game incorrectly states that if both parents have the same trait, it will get inherited (it will, just not as an active trait), the actual factors for genetic inheritance are complicated, see [[Family (relation)]]. The name of some leveled traits depends on the character's gender.

== Lifestyle traits ==
Lifestyle traits can be obtained through either the final perk of each [[Lifestyle]] tree or as a result of Lifestyle [[Decisions]]. They are available for custom rulers even if the required DLC is not installed. Adding lifestyle traits to a custom ruler will not unlock the prerequisite perks. Resetting lifestyle perks remove the lifestyle traits as well.

== Coping mechanisms ==
A coping mechanism is a trait that can be obtained when a character suffers a [[mental break]] and helps a character lose {{iconify|stress}} and usually imparts negative effects. A few coping mechanisms impart only positive effects and are rare but can be obtained more easily by having the ''Whole of Body'' lifestyle focus. Each coping mechanism unlocks a unique decision.

== Childhood traits ==
Characters between 3 and 15 years old can have one childhood trait. Childhood traits grant a minor bonus to two Skills and if the child is given an Education Focus that matches one of the two Skills the trait improves, then the trait can improve the level of the education trait given when the character reaches adulthood. If creating a custom ruler each childhood trait costs 5 customization points.

== Health traits ==
A Health trait is a negative trait that lowers a character's {{iconify|Health}} and is visible on the character. They last a varying amount of time and differ greatly in lethality.

The visual effect of certain health traits can be replaced with one from a lesser trait by disabling ''Show graphic diseases and injuries'' option in the settings menu.

=== Wounds ===
There are three traits of increasing severity that represents a character's current level of wounds. They are increased as part of various events, hunts, duels, or battles, and have a chance to be reduced every 3 months. The chance to reduce wounds decreases with the character's age and {{iconify|Stress}}. They cannot be added to custom characters. If a character gets wounded while they already have the highest level of wounds they will die. When a character fully recovers from wounds they have a 40% chance to gain or increase the {{iconify|Scarred}} trait.

|}
Each time a character's wounds increase, there is a 10% chance that 2 or 3 months later the wound will become infected, giving a severe {{iconify|Health Penalty}}. 3 months later there is a 15% chance the infection will go away and a 10% chance the infection will be replaced by gangrene, giving an even more severe {{iconify|Health Penalty}}.

=== Diseases ===
Diseases are Health traits that can be spread from one character to another. If a character recovers from a disease they become immune to it. Immunity is permanent for the Bubonic Plague, Smallpox and Measles and lasts 20 years for other traits. There is no immunity against the Ill trait. STD diseases are congenital and can also be spread to other characters if sleeping with them.

Each year a character has a 10% chance to gain a Diseases trait, though this can be reduced in multiple ways. Diseases are also gained from plagues being in the domain or travel baronies. The Bubonic Plague may or may not appear depending on game rules.

The health penalties can be reduced or canceled if a {{icon|court physician}} Personal Physician with sufficient Aptitude was employed.

=== Incapable ===
Incapable is the most severe health trait and cannot be added at character creation. It prevents the character from having children, declaring war, performing schemes, hosting or joining activities, being councilors or knights, or taking part in duels, and forces them into an Entrenched Regency. It prevents them from making decisions except for the newly-unlocked Attempt Suicide decision and if the character has a royal court the throne will be empty. It also brings the following penalties:

== Immortal ==
The Immortal trait can only be added when creating custom characters. It makes the character immortal: they do not visibly age, years do not affect their attributes, their {{iconify|Fertility}} does not decrease and they cannot gain the {{iconify|Incapable}} trait. It also cancels the Long Reign bonus. The trait costs 10000 points so it will always invalidate achievements.
