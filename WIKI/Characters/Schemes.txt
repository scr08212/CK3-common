[[File:Schemes example.png|thumb|330px|Two schemes against well-chosen targets]]
Any character can be targeted with a '''scheme''' in accordance with the plans of the schemer. Each character can run one scheme of each type at the same time. Ongoing schemes can be canceled at any point. Various events can take place during a scheme.

Some traits, characteristic or statuses of the schemer and target can influence various values in a scheme. A hideous character, for example, would take significant penalty in seducing others. Higher-ranked characters are harder to be targeted by lower-ranked ones. 

== Scheme mechanics ==
Each scheme has 2 values to keep track of:
* {{icon|scheme success chance}} Success Chance determines how likely it is for the scheme to succeed when it is executed and grows over time.
* {{icon|scheme phase length}} Phase Length determines how fast the scheme progresses. On Personal schemes it determines when the scheme completes and on Hostile and Political schemes it determines how long does it take to gain Advantage.

Hostile and Political schemes have 4 additional values.
* {{icon|scheme potential}} Potential determines the maximum Success Chance. The schemer's skills can give up to 30% Potential, with the rest coming from agents. Potential cannot exceed 95% except for contract schemes.
* {{icon|scheme secrecy}} Secrecy determines how likely it is for a scheme to remain undetected by the target. The chance for the scheme to be discovered upon execution is equal to the missing Secrecy and the chance for the scheme to gain a Breach each month is equal to a tenth of the missing Secrecy. Secrecy has no effects during Grace. Grace is normally six months, but raises to ten months with the [[File:Node intrigue.png|24px]] Court of Shadows perk.
* [[File:Scheme breach.png|24px]] Breaches is how many times the scheme has been breached and reduces Success Chance. If it reaches 5 the scheme automatically fails.
* [[File:Scheme opportunity.png|24px]] Advantage are used to execute the scheme or offered as enticements to agents. Once at least 5 Advantage has been obtained, the scheme can be executed. Alternatively it may be executed using 10, 15 or 20 Advantage to further increased its Success Chance. A scheme starts with 1 Advantage for every 5 points of {{iconify|Intrigue}} the schemer has over 15.

== Hostile schemes ==
Hostile schemes use agents and secrecy. If secrecy fails the targeted character will gain an imprisonment reason on the schemer. Hostile schemes cannot target the schemer's own children unless the schemer has the {{iconify|Sadistic}} trait.

== Personal schemes ==
Personal schemes do not use secrecy or agents. A failure prevents the scheme from being used again on the same character and may cause additional penalties.

== Political schemes ==
{{expansion|rtp|auh}}
Political schemes are only available between characters with {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative or {{iconify|Celestial}} government. They have no failure effects beyond giving {{iconify|Stress}}. The only exception is Raid Estate. If a vassal is discovered performing the scheme the liege will consider them a criminal unless the character obtained a remit. If the liege is discovered performing the scheme they will become rivals with the target.

== Agents ==
Most hostile and political schemes can have up to 5 agents - adult characters who contribute to the scheme. Only the target's courtiers, guests and direct vassals can be invited as agents and only if they are not improsoned or part of another scheme. Agents come in many types, which determines what scheme stat they will increase and which skills and traits will increase their contribution. The contribution of each agent is capped at {{green|+50}}. A scheming character is protected from discovery while the scheme progresses but its agents are not.

Once a scheme has started, characters can be invited into the agent slots. Acceptance depends on the agent's {{iconify|Opinion}} of the schemer and the schemer's skills and decreases with the title rank of the scheme's target of if the target is in another realm. For hostile schemes the AI personality of the agent also has a large impact:
* Boldness does not influence directly, but it does make the agent less likely to be intimidated or terrified by the target, therefore increasing the chance.
* Compassion decreases the chance of accepting signifiantly (-4 per 10 Compassion), particularly if the target is a child. Increases slightly if extremely low compassion (+10 at -100) (i.e Sadistic or Callous).
* Honor decreases the chance of accepting significantly if they have positive {{iconify|Opinion}} of the target. Low Honor increases the chance significantly if they have negative {{iconify|Opinion}} of the target.
* Greed increases the chance of accepting if they are in the succession line for one of the target's titles, decreases significantly if nothing to gain.
* Vengefulness increases the chance of accepting if the target slighted them before.
* Zeal increases the chance of accepting with faith hostility towards the target's faith.
* Energy doesn't have any effect when positive, but decreases base reluctance if below 0.

When inviting a character to become an agent they can be offered enticements. Offering an enticement increases their acceptance and prevents them from voluntarily leaving the scheme for 5 years. Enticements can be 3 or 5 [[File:Scheme opportunity.png|24px]] Advantage, 100 or 200 {{iconify|Gold}}, 300 {{iconify|Prestige}}, offering a Hook, using a Hook, or granting a county that's de jure theirs. Characters who are terrified of the scheme target will never become agents except through the use of a {{iconify|Strong Hook}}.

Each agent can also contribute to their agent type scheme stat regardless of their exact agent type based on their closeness to the scheme target. Having the target's Spymaster as an agent adds as much success chance as the Spymaster has {{iconify|Intrigue}}.

The following agents increase {{icon|scheme success chance}} Scheme Potential. The Eunuch agent type is only available for agents with the {{iconify|Eunuch}} or {{iconify|Beardless Eunuch}} trait and requires either the schemer or the target's culture to have the Court Eunuchs, Byzantine Traditions or Palace Politics tradition. The Devotee agent type can only be added by events from having a positive Camp Temperament.

== Countermeasure focus ==
Each character can choose a Countermeasure Focus, which will give them a bonus against certain schemes but cause various penalties. They come in three tiers. Tier 2 countermeasure focuses are unlocked by the {{iconify|Paranoid}} trait or the Palace Politics tradition. Tier 3 countermeasures are unlocked by certain traditions, tenets or traits.

Most countermeasures affect all members of the court, with the exception of "Withdraw from View" which only affects the ruler using the countermeasure.
