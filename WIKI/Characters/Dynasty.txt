[[File:Dynasty example.png|thumb|330px|A reputable dynasty]]
A '''Dynasty''' represents an unbroken noble line descending from the same Landed character who founded the dynasty. Each dynasty is made up of multiple '''Houses''' working towards bringing Renown upon the dynasty. A dynasty can be renamed by the Dynasty Head at any point.

== Houses ==
Each dynasty will have a Founding House, usually of the same name as the dynasty, which is the first house of that dynasty. Ruling members of a dynasty may choose to create a Cadet Branch, a new house under the dynasty. Each house has its own name and motto, usually inspired by the location in which they are founded and the founding character, which can be changed at will by the House Head. They will also have a unique coat of arms that has two quarters copied from the dynasty coat of arms.

If a House Head demands the religious conversion of a house member and the member refuses, it will result in the creation of a new Cadet Branch.

Characters are born into father's house in Patrilineal marriage, or mother's house in Matrilineal marriage.

=== House head ===
The House Head is the leader of a house. House Heads have the power to legitimize bastards, call house members to war at no cost and demand that they convert to their Faith. In addition, House Heads will get a {{iconify|Weak Hook}} on all newly born house members and monthly prestige from living and landed members of their house. If a faith has the ''Must be Approved'' doctrine for divorces but no [[head of faith]], the House Head must approve of divorces. When a House Head dies, their Primary Heir becomes the next House Head.

When a character creates a Cadet Branch, they become its House Head, and free from the direct influence of their old House Head unless they were the Dynasty Head.

If a character who has the {{iconify|Extolled by House}} or {{iconify|Accused of Decadence}} trait becomes House Head they will lose the trait.

==== Dynasty head ====
The most powerful House Head of a dynasty will be the Dynasty Head. If another House Head becomes 10% stronger than the current Dynasty Head it will take its place. Most of the time Dynasty Head is calculated by military strength, but if all House Heads have {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative, {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} or {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} government then it will be calculated by powerful family rating.

The Dynasty Head gains Monthly Prestige from living and landed members of their dynasty. The Dynasty Head can always disinherit and also has access to the following interactions with dynasty members of the same faith:
{| class="mildtable plainlist"
! Interaction
! Effects
! Cost
|-
| Call Dynasty Member To War

* 100 {{iconify|Renown}} and 300 {{iconify|Prestige}} if Dynasty Member is Heir to a title
* 125 {{iconify|Renown}} and 500 {{iconify|Prestige}} if Dynasty Member is Landed
|-

|-
| Forgive
| Targeted Dynasty Member loses the [[File:Trait denounced.png|24px]] Denounced trait and the {{iconify|Opinion}} malus
| 
* 25 {{iconify|Renown}}
|}
If the first [[File:Adventure legacy track.png|24px]] Adventure legacy has been unlocked Dynasty Heads will also gain the ''Send to the Varangian Guard'' interaction. Using it costs 350 {{iconify|Prestige}}, sends an unlanded and unmarried Dynasty Member to the court of the Byzantine Empire and gives them the {{iconify|Varangian}} trait. The interaction is not limited to Diplomatic Range but is not available if the Dynasty Head's faith has the Pacifism tenet, the Dynasty Head is at war or truce with the Byzantine Empire or the Byzantine Empire title was destroyed.

If a character who has the {{iconify|Denounced}} or {{iconify|Disinherited}} trait becomes Dynasty Head they will lose the trait.

=== Adoption ===
Adoption is available to rulers who are unmarried or in a marriage that brings children into their house and allows them to adopt a child character into their House. It requires one of the following:
* {{iconify|Compassionate}} trait
* No child and low {{iconify|Fertility}}
* Unmarried and Sexuality is [[File:Homosexual male.png|24px]][[File:Homosexual female.png|24px]] Homosexual or [[File:Asexual.png|24px]] Asexual
* Culture has the Noble Adoption tradition
* Spouse has the same sex and there is no opposite gender Consort or Concubine
* Adoption game rule is set to Always Allowed

Children cannot be adopted if they are imprisoned, they or close or extended family members are landed or they are already part of the same house.

Each Adoption costs {{iconify|Piety}} depending on the child's faith:
* 0 if the faith is Righteous or same faith
* 100 if faith is Astray
* 150 if faith is Hostile
* 250 if faith is Evil

Acceptance is increased by having no parents, friendship, guardianship, shared personality traits or if the child has the {{iconify|Ambitious}} trait. Acceptance can be decreased by having parents or being already part of a house.

Adopting decreases the {{iconify|Opinion}} of all children without the {{iconify|Content}} trait by {{red|-20}}.

{{expansion|rtp}}
Adventurers can always adopt a follower regardless of age. In their case the adopted follower will join the character's dynasty but create a new house. Adopting as an adventurer costs 150 {{iconify|Prestige}} unless the character's culture has the Noble Adoption tradition. If the adventurer had a heir, the heir will become rivals with the adopted follower and lose {{red|-15}} {{iconify|Opinion}}. Followers cannot be adopted if they have the {{iconify|Devoted}} or {{iconify|Gallivanter}} traits.

=== House relations ===
When members of different houses interact it will improve or worsen relations between the houses. The following actions affect house relations. If none of these actions happen for 50 years house relations will move one level towards Neutral.

=== Blocs ===
{{expansion|auh}}
Blocs are defensive alliances between rulers from different houses present in Japan and also block members from going to war against each other. Only house heads can leave blocs or ask to join another bloc. If a house leaves a bloc all its members will gain a 5-year truce will all members of houses from their previous bloc. Leaving a bloc will also give {{red|-30%}} House Relation with the bloc's leading house and {{red|-15}} Opinion with its house head. Leaving a house bloc is free but joining a house bloc costs 100 {{iconify|Prestige}}. A member who joins a bloc cannot leave it for 10 years.

Every bloc has a leader, and its house head decides if another house can join the bloc, can remove houses from the bloc at will, and is the only character who can create factions. Only the bloc leader can create factions against the top liege and all bloc house members will automatically join the faction. A bloc leader cannot join another bloc but can always pass leadership to another house of their bloc, which will give {{green|+30%}} House Relation with it.

Every bloc has a Cohesion, which ranges from 0 to 100 and gives bonuses to all members depending on the leader's family attribute. It is affected by the relation between all member houses and decreased by the number of landed rulers in the bloc. It is also increased by {{green|+0.25}} by every house that has the same family attribute as the leading house and decreased by {{red|-0.25}} for every house that has a different family attribute from the leading house and by {{red|-0.1}} each month by every member house. If Cohesion reaches 0 the bloc will be disbanded.

Only house heads with {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} or {{iconify|Sōryō}} government can create or join a bloc but their house members will be part of it regardless of government.

There are 4 or 5 blocs in every start date. Every bloc starts with 50 Cohesion.

== Disinheriting ==
Disinheriting is a character interaction that will give the targeted character the [[File:Trait disinherited.png|24px]] Disinherited trait and a permanent {{red|-75}} {{iconify|Opinion}}. It can be reversed at any point at the cost of 75 {{iconify|Renown}}. Disinheriting requires the target to be a vassal and is not available towards characters with a {{iconify|Strong Hook}}.

Dynasty Heads can disinherit any member of their dynasty for the following cost:
* Free if the targeted character has the {{iconify|Disputed Heritage}} or {{iconify|Bastard}} trait.
* 75 {{iconify|Renown}} and 150 {{iconify|Prestige}} if the dynasty member is Unlanded
* 150 {{iconify|Renown}} and 300 {{iconify|Prestige}} if the dynasty member is Heir to a title
* 225 {{iconify|Renown}} and 900 {{iconify|Prestige}} if the dynasty member is Landed or part of an Administrative family
* 50 {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if the dynasty member is not the Dynasty Head's child or primary title heir
* 100 {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if the dynasty member is the Dynasty Head's child but not primary title heir
* 200 {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if the dynasty member is the Dynasty Head's primary title heir
* 20 {{icon|opinion}} General Opinion for 5 years

If the Fate of Iberia DLC is installed all dynasty members, including the Dynasty Head, can disinherit their own children with the last [[File:Coterie legacy track.png|24px]] Coterie legacy. This disinheritance does not cost {{iconify|Renown}} but it gives {{red|-30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with all vassals.

== Renown ==
Renown is a resource accumulated by a dynasty and is used for the most powerful Dynasty Head interactions, unlocking legacies and increasing a dynasty's level of Splendor. Each living dynasty member will add Renown to the dynasty, and Prestige to its Dynasty Head and House Head.
{| class="mildtable" style="text-align: center;

|}
Being married to a ruler of another dynasty grants 80% of the Renown their primary title generates.

Renown gain is capped at {{green|+2}} for total non-ruler house members (100 members). Dynasty Head Prestige gain is capped at {{green|+3}}. House Head Prestige gain is capped at {{green|+5}}. Rulers will not add Renown to their dynasty if any Liege is a member of the same dynasty.

=== Level of Splendor ===
Firstly, all renown earned by a dynasty counts towards its Level of Splendor, which determines how well-known the dynasty is in the eyes of the world. Having a high level also makes it much easier to arrange marriages, especially with Dynasties with a Lower Level of Splendor. The Level of Splendor will only decrease if a player character attempts suicide. Peasant Dynasties start at Base Origins. The alliance acceptance bonus does not apply if both characters are part of the same dynasty.

=== Dynasty legacies ===
Dynasty legacies are permanent bonuses that can be unlocked by the Dynasty Head and affect every member of a dynasty. Each legacy track contains five legacies. If an AI character becomes Dynasty Head it will only unlock legacies belonging to the track with the most current progress. If the AI selects Architected Ancestry a random trait will be chosen.

The first dynasty legacy costs 250 {{iconify|Renown}} to unlock and each one afterwards costs 500 more than the previous one.
