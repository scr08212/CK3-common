There are four important resources which are necessary for most actions in the game: {{iconify|gold}}, {{iconify|prestige}}, {{iconify|piety}} and {{iconify|renown}}. Each resource can be spent on different things and all of them can be spent or gained through events.

== Gold ==
Gold is a measure of a character's liquid wealth reserves. Most rulers start the game with gold equal to 18 months of income. When a ruler dies or abdicates, all of their gold is passed onto their primary heir regardless of succession law.

=== Treasury ===
{{expansion|rtp|auh}}
Rulers with {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative, {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}} or {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} government have a second storage for Gold called Treasury. 95% of income obtained from vassals will be added to the Treasury instead of Gold. Gold can be manually converted to Treasury. Every 10 Gold transferred gives {{red|+1}} Stress if the character has the {{iconify|Greedy}} trait and {{green|-1}} Stress if the character has the {{iconify|Generous}} trait. Treasury can be converted to Gold via the Siphon Treasury scheme and is also converted to Gold if the character changes government.

The Treasury can be spent on barony constructions, provincial men-at-arms, a few activities, salaries, great project contributions, and royal court expenses. Gold still has to be spent for estate constructions, personal men-at-arms, most activities, and schemes.

The top liege of a government that uses Treasury can use the Laws tab to allocate percentages of the Treasury income back to vassals as Gold. The amount of Gold each vassal receives depends on their primary title rank and {{iconify|Merit}} if their government uses it. Changing the allocated percentages costs 200 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 500 {{iconify|Influence}} and will give between {{red|-100}} and {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 5 years depending on how much the spending has been changed. If the realm gains new vassals they will receive Gold too but existing vassals will not have it reduced, requiring a greater expenditure of Treasury until the percentages are reallocated again. For {{iconify|Celestial}} governments the councilor salary is also decided here.

=== Debt ===
Debt occurs when a character has negative gold or treasury. During debt, characters cannot declare war, their counties can always acquire corruption, their men-at-arms cannot reinforce, and they can experience various negative events. In addition, debt grants increasingly negative modifiers the longer it goes on. The penalty is reset when the ruler changes.

== Prestige ==
{{iconify|Prestige}} represents the amount of political capital, social influence and goodwill a character is able make use of at any given time. Holding titles, especially of higher rank, as well as the {{iconify|diplomacy|link=Attributes#Skills}} skill are the main continuous sources of prestige, but many events can generate it on occasion as well. Prestige can be spent on most secular matters of realm of management, such as vassal interactions, decisions and declarations of non-holy war. For {{iconify|Tribal}} and {{iconify|Wanua}} rulers, Prestige is also used for [[men-at-arms]] payment and upkeep, as well as constructing tribe buildings.

Each time a character gains prestige, they gain the same amount of fame; battles fought in secular wars, as well as winning certain wars as war leader, will also net fame, while losing certain wars as war leader will lose fame. As fame accrues, it will increase progress towards the character's next level of fame, which grants various benefits, such as enabling [[decisions]] or certain types of [[casus belli]]. Fame also affects the amount of taxes and levies received from {{iconify|Tribal}} and {{iconify|Wanua}} vassals. Since fame is meant to merely accumulate, not be spent, it rarely decreases, but particularly dishonorable acts can cost levels of fame. A character who lacks the prestige to declare a secular war can also opt to spend fame, at an inflated price. Fame is particularly important for adventurers, as it determines who will offer them contracts.

Notably, "A Life of Glory" perk from the Diplomacy [[Lifestyle]], doubles the effects of Secular Opinion and Knights (including the penalties).

== Piety ==
{{iconify|Piety}} is a measure of how virtuous a character is in the eye of others of their religion. It is gained primarily from religious relations, the character's {{iconify|learning}} skill, and traits that its faith considers virtuous. Piety is spent when interacting with the church and declaring holy wars. The icon displayed for representing piety depends on the character's religion.

Each time a character gains piety, they will also gain {{iconify|devotion}}, which gives progress towards their next level of devotion. Like the levels of fame above, each level of devotion grants various benefits. A character will lose a level of devotion if they are caught doing something their faith doctrines consider shunned. A character can pay a piety cost with devotion if they don't have enough piety. Generated characters and those at the game start begin with the {{iconify|Dutiful}} level.

The last three levels of devotion are only available to rulers with {{iconify|Mandala}} government if their predecessor reached the previous level of devotion and died in an acceptable manner. Characters with the [[File:Family attribute humility small.png|24px]] Humility noble family attribute at the highest level can also reach the Divine level of devotion. Rulers with {{iconify|Mandala}} government also inherit the level of devotion held by their predecessor.

== Provisions ==
{{expansion|rtp}}
{{iconify|Provisions}} is a resource available only to adventurers and is spent when moving the camp. How many are expended depends on the size of the men-at-arms, the terrain on the route, and what officers are hired, and they can also be lost as a result of travel danger events. They are primarily obtained as contract rewards, hunts, visiting holdings, or the Gather Provisions decision.

Each adventurer can initially store up to 2500 provisions, but the capacity can be increased by certain camp buildings and upgrades. If an adventurer receives provisions above the limit they will instead receive 1 {{iconify|gold}} per 20 {{iconify|provisions}}.

If provisions become too low while traveling the following events may take place. If provisions become 0 the adventurer will be offered the option to stop in the current barony and avoid the worst events.

== Herd ==
{{expansion|kos}}
{{iconify|Herd}} is a resource available only to characters with {{iconify|Nomadic}} government and represents their flock of animals. It is used as a currency between nomads, serves as a gate for increasing Dominance, and a percentage of it is converted into {{iconify|Horde Riders}}. The character with the highest Herd will become the culture head of its culture. Every 1000 Herd increases Gold income by 0.5 and if the character changes government it is converted to Gold.

Every nomad character has a herd capacity, which is determined by their title rank, level of fame and Nomadic Capital buildings and upgrades. Going over the herd capacity reduces herd gain to only 5% of its normal value.

Herd is obtained through the land by exploiting its Fertility and through nomad subjects via their contracts. Every county in the Steppe regions has a Fertility ranging from 0 to 100. While the county is held by a ruler with {{iconify|Nomadic}} government its fertility will decrease until it reaches an Equilibrium value. While the county is held by a ruler with {{iconify|Herder}} government its fertility will increase. The Equilibrium increases with the number of baronies in the ruler's domain.

If a ruler is landless it will lose between 500 and a third of is Herd every 3 years.

== Barter Goods ==
{{expansion|auh}}
{{iconify|Barter Goods}} is a resource available only to characters with {{iconify|Wanua}} government and represents island resources. It is used for army upkeep and armies can convert it to {{iconify|Gold}} at a 2:1 ratio by being raised as barterers and traveling to another ruler's counties.
