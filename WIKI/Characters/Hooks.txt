[[File:Hooks and Secrets.jpg|thumb|330px|Hooks and secrets]]
A hook represents that a character owes you a favor or that you can coerce them in some way. Hooks can be gained in a variety of ways and can be used to force a character to do something. You can only have one hook on a character at a time. If you gain a new hook and it's a stronger type of hook or lasts longer, it replaces the older one. Having a hook of any kind over an opponent during a non-lethal duel unlocks a [[Duel#Special moves|special move]], Something to Hide. Hook come in three levels of strength. Hooks that are permanent cannot be removed with the Abandon Hook interaction.

== Weak hooks ==
Weak hooks can only be used once. For most interactions a weak hook only provides a bonus to acceptance rather than forced action. The hook name has some narrow effects. The ''Obligation'' hook halves the monthly base salary of assigned [[court]] positions (it does not affect task expenses).

== Perpetual hooks ==
Perpetual hooks are permanent and can be used multiple times with a five year cool-down between uses. For most interactions a perpetual hook only provides a bonus to acceptance rather than forced action. Perpetual hooks cannot be fabricated.
* {{icon|wrd}} '''Loyal Hostage''' hooks can be obtained from events if a hostage becomes an adult
* {{icon|cor}} '''Indebted Claimant''' hooks are obtained on every installed claimant if a ruler fulfills a Install Claimants oath
* {{icon|auh}} '''Filial Piety''' hooks are obtained at birth if the faith has the Filial Piety tenet

== Strong hooks ==
Strong hooks can be used multiple times with a five year cool-down between uses. For most interactions using a strong hook will force acceptance. Passively, it also prevents the character from joining factions, declaring war, imprisoning or demanding religious conversion from the character holding the hook. Having a strong hook over a Realm Priest forces them to pay maximum contribution.

== Secrets ==
Characters acquire secrets when they do something that is a crime or frowned upon. Secrets can be discovered through random events or via the ''Find Secrets'' spymaster [[Council#Council_task|task]]. If a secret is discovered, the character who uncovered it has two options. One option is to expose the secret, which will apply negative effects upon the target based on the severity of the secret. The other option is to blackmail the target. If the target agrees to the blackmail, the character will gain a {{iconify|Weak Hook}} if the secret is Shunned and a {{iconify|Strong Hook}} if the secret is Criminal. If the target refuses, the secret will be exposed. Secrets can be shared with members of the same House if the Dynasty has the 4th [[File:Coterie legacy track.png|24px]] Coterie legacy.

If a character is asked to convert to a faith practiced in secret they will always agree.
