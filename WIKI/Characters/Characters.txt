{{Version|1.18}}
A character refers to any person, historical or generated, that is represented personally in Crusader Kings III. Every single character is an individual, living entity that will act individually and has the potential to change history. Characters can be either noble or lowborn, and landed or unlanded.
* Noble characters are members of a [[dynasty]].
* Lowborn characters are not members of a dynasty. If they are landed with a playable [[government]] title they will become noble and found a dynasty.
* Landed characters own at least one holding.
* Unlanded characters do not own any holdings; a character who ''Leases'' holdings (e.g. a Realm Priest) is considered an unlanded character.
All Characters are part of a certain [[Religion]] and [[Culture]], and may have a [[Attributes|variety of Attributes]], [[Traits]], [[Modifiers]] and [[Resources]] that further shape each individual. Some may even attempt to interact with others through [[Schemes]].

If they are landed, they will also have [[Titles]], [[Council]] (if they are at least a [[County|Count]]), a specific [[Government]], a [[Lifestyle]] and a [[Court]].

== Appearance ==
Characters are depicted using a 3D portrait system. Every character's physical appearance is internally determined by a DNA system, which defines how they look: facial features, skin pigmentation, height, and hair color are all stored as DNA. This DNA is dynamically generated for courtiers, and can be directly edited with the [[Ruler Designer]]. DNA is stored as dominant and recessive genes and [[Breeding|passed on to a character's children]], affecting their appearance. 

As Crusader Kings III covers a large portion of Eurasia and North Africa in its setting, characters can be from a diverse number of ethnicities: West/Central European, Northern European, Slavic, Arctic, Mediterranean, West African, East African, Arabic, Asian, North Indian, or South Indian.

Their appearance is further determined by age, weight, and certain congenital traits. Characters will age as years pass by, eventually growing old and withering away. Their appearance can also be adversely affected by illness or injury; battle wounds may scar their face, while disease can leave a ghastly impact on their visage.

=== Barbershop ===
Players can adjust the appearance of their ruler or ruler's family members via the Barbershop window. This allows hair and clothing to be changed, overriding the character's default appearance.

== Sexual Orientation ==

A character's sexual orientation determines with which gender they will gain [[attraction]] opinion and can form [[lover]] relations. It is decided when the character is around 10 years old and cannot be changed. AI characters will never try to form a [[relation]] with characters that do not match their sexual orientation. Both the initial distribution of sexual orientation and the chance for [[child|children]] to gain a certain sexual orientation is determined by the sexuality distribution [[game rule]].

If the child is played by a player, there is a 20% chance that the player will get to pick the gender preference.
{{clear}}


== Opinion ==
Each character has an {{icon|opinion}} opinion of every other character. The {{iconify|opinion}} the player character holds influences the success rate of certain actions that target another character while the {{iconify|opinion}} of AI characters also determines their behavior towards other characters.

When a character [[death|dies]], their [[primary heir]] will temporarily inherit part of the {{iconify|opinion}} of vassals towards the late [[liege]], shown as ''Opinion of Predecessor''.
* {{green|Positive}} opinion towards predecessor: 25% of {{iconify|opinion}} is inherited.
* {{red|Negative}} opinion towards predecessor: 50% of {{iconify|opinion}} is inherited.

== Opinion ==

=== General ===
General is an {{iconify|opinion}} modifier that affects '''every character''', this means only Popular Opinion of Counties are independent of this modifier. See also [[Attributes]].

These are modifiers that influence General {{iconify|opinion}}:

* {{green|+10}} Dynasty Legacy "Glory" (tier 5)
* {{red|-8}} ~ {{green|+92}} Personal Diplomacy Skill
* {{red|-2}} ~ {{red|-126}} Trait "Gallows bait"

* {{red|-10}} Trait "Sadistic"
* {{red|-15}} Trait "Murderer"
* {{red|-25}} Modifier "Attacked An Ally"
* {{red|-50}} Modifier "Broken Truce"

=== Attraction ===
Attraction is an {{iconify|opinion}} modifier that can only be held towards characters one's sexual preference allows. Male characters aged above 65 years and female character above 50 years are not affected by attraction. Only adults (16 year old and above) can generate attraction and have attraction towards another.

These are modifiers that influence Attraction{{iconify|opinion}}:

* {{green|+10}} Trait "Brave"
* {{green|+5}}/{{green|+10}} Trait "Hunter" (Falconer way) (Level 1/Level 2)
* {{green|+5}}/{{green|+10}}/{{green|+15}} Trait "Amazonian"/("Herculean")/"Robust"/"Hale"
* {{green|+5}} Trait "Gregarious"
* {{red|-30}}/{{red|-20}}/{{red|-10}}/{{green|+10}}/{{green|+20}}/{{green|+30}} Trait "Hideous"/"Ugly"/"Homely"/"Comely"/"Handsome"("Pretty")/"Beautiful"

=== Same Dynasty ===
Dynasty is an {{iconify|opinion}} modifier that affects everyone of the same dynasty.

These are modifiers that influence Same Dynasty {{iconify|opinion}}:

* "Mystical Ancestors" [[Traditions|Tradition]]: {{green|+10}}
* Same Dynasty: {{green|+5}}
* Tier-3 "Legitimacy" Legacy: {{green|+5}}
* Tier-4 "Kin" Legacy: {{green|+5}}
* "Dynastic Kinslayer" Trait: {{red|-5}}
* "Familial Kinslayer" Trait: {{red|-5}}
* "Kinslayer" Trait: {{red|-5}}
* "Dininherited" Trait: {{red|-5}}
* "Gallivanter" Trait: {{red|-10}}
* "Legitimized Bastard" Trait: {{red|-10}}
* "Bastard" Trait: {{red|-15}}

==== Virtue & Sins ====
Some traits are considered virtuous or sinful in certain faiths, the opinion modifier will be dependant on the character whose faith sees certain traits as virtuous or sinful. (e,g, a Muslim who has the "Forgiving" trait would have no modifiers from other Muslims, have {{green|+10}} (virtue) modifier from Christians and {{red|-10}} (sin) modifier with Asatruans).

==== Faith Hostility ====
Faith Hostility is determined by the Religious Families to be Righteous/Astray/Hostile/Evil, and are then given 0/{{red|-10}}/{{red|-20}}/{{red|-30}} opinion maluses, respectively.

* "Pluralist" Doctrine: {{green|-50%}} faith hostility opinion malus
* "Fundamentalist" Doctrine {{red|+100%}} faith hostility opinion malus
The opinion malus from other characters is dependant by how hostile the other faith sees that faith that you belong to as, not how hostile your faith sees their faith as. 

The "Pluralist" and "Fundamentalist" Doctrines affect how much maluses to opinion '''they have for''' '''you''', not vice-versa.

=== Relations ===
When certain requirements are met, two characters can have one of three types of relations, with each type having three levels. Relations have a great impact on how two characters act towards each other.
* Childhood relations can only be held between two child characters and might evolve into their corresponding [[adult]]hood relations when the characters reach adulthood
* Adulthood relations can be gained and lost as a result of [[event]]s
* Lifelong relations can only be obtained towards characters with an existing adulthood relation and each character can have only one of each lifelong relation

Two characters who have {{iconify|Nomadic}} government or the {{iconify|Way of the Nomad}} trait can swear a Blood Brotherhood with each other as long as they're not family members. Being Blood Brothers has the same benefits as being Friends but also gives the characters a {{iconify|Strong Hook}} on each other, forms an alliance and allows choosing a [[Modifiers#Blood_Brother_modifiers|Blood Brother]] modifier if any is available. Each character can only have one Blood Brother. The relation will end if a call to war from a Blood Brother is refused.

=== Tyranny ===
Tyranny is {{icon|opinion}} {{red|negative}} opinion gained by rulers who take unjust actions. It is felt by vassals and [[courtier]]s towards a liege. The maximum tyranny a character can have is {{red|1000}}. Tyranny is not gained if the liege has a valid reason.

== Diplomatic range ==
The diplomatic range is the distance within which two characters can [[interactions|interact]] with each other. Neighboring [[realm]]s are always within diplomatic range of each other, as well as realms separated by no more than three sea zones.

* The first [[Dynasty|Dynasty Legacy]] from the Adventure Legacy Tree from Northern Lords DLC increases Diplomatic Range by 30%.
* The [[Building#Historical buildings|Rock of Gibraltar]] increases Diplomatic Range by 20%.

Diplomatic range map mode is only available in debug mode.

== Nicknames ==
[[Nickname]]s are epithets granted to characters and are displayed either before or after a character's name. They are mainly gained through {{icon|decision}} [[decision]]s and events.

== AI Personality ==
AI characters will act based on the following attributes:
* '''Boldness:''' Characters with high Boldness are less affected by {{iconify|Dread}} and more likely to declare war on rulers of similar or higher strength, accept and propose Duels and take risks. Characters with low Boldness are more affected by {{iconify|Dread}} and more likely to declare war on weaker rulers, accept faction ultimatums and more reluctant to try to imprison Strong Vassals and take risks.
* '''Compassion:''' Characters with high Compassion are more likely to release prisoners (especially children), use the [[File:Task accept culture.png|24px]] Promote Cultural Acceptance steward task, let people marry for love and make friends and more reluctant to harm others, use the Murder scheme, execute prisoners or torture prisoners. Characters with low Compassion are more likely to harm others, use Hostile schemes, execute prisoners or torture prisoners.
* '''Greed:''' Characters with high Greed will more often choose short-term gains, go on Raids, use the [[File:Task collect taxes.png|24px]] Collect Taxes steward task, betray other characters for {{icon|Gold}} and {{iconify|Title}}s and pay less on contracts and are more reluctant to pay ransom, send gifts, accept title revocations and end wars in [[File:War outcome white peace.png|24px]] White Peace. Characters with low Greed will more often spend {{iconify|Gold}}, pay ransom, send gifts, accept title revocations and host activities and pay more on contracts and are more reluctant to betray other characters for {{icon|Gold}} and {{iconify|Title}}s.
* '''Honor:''' Characters with high Honor are more likely to follow Laws and honor Alliances and more reluctant to blackmail characters with Secrets. Characters with low Honor are more likely to start hostile Schemes, blackmail characters with Secrets, use the [[File:Task find secrets.png|24px]] Find Secrets spymaster task and betray their friends and spouses.
* '''Rationality:''' Characters with high Rationality are more likely to use the [[File:Task disrupt schemes.png|24px]] Disrupt Schemes spymaster task, peace out of wars when they last more than 6 months and start Murder schemes against a liege with Tyranny and try to fix debts and are more reluctant to gain Tyranny. Characters with low Rationality are more likely to gain Tyranny, get into inopportune wars and continue wars for more than 6 months.
* '''Sociability:''' determines how often the character will consider a character interaction.
* '''Vengefulness:''' Characters will high Vengefulness will more often seek to harm Rivals and cheating Spouses and request Excommunication to punish criminals and will less often forgive slights and transgressions. Characters with low Vengefulness will more often forgive slights and transgressions, refuse to punish prisoners and pardon criminals and do not start hostile schemes targeting Rivals and cheating Spouses any more than other characters.
* '''Zeal:''' Characters with high Zeal are more likely to join defensively against Holy Wars, pledge or donate to Great Holy Wars, convert counties or vassals, go on pilgrimages and take actions that grant {{iconify|Piety}} and more reluctant to convert to other faiths. Characters with low Zeal are more likely to ignore Faith in politics and use it as a tool and more reluctant to take actions that grant {{iconify|Piety}} or accept requests from rulers with Theocracy government.

Each AI character will have its personality described with an adjective and a noun based on the highest amount of the value of two attributes. Children who do not have any traits yet will instead be described as Balanced, as are those who have little to no personality tendencies.

Every character will have a pose that is determined by the highest or lowest value that the character in question has, with the pose being slightly different between male and female characters (i.e High boldness characters will stand confidently, low boldness characters will cower meekly).

=== Economical Archetype ===
An AI ruler would spend their {{Iconify|Gold}} according to the following archetypes based on their traits and attributes:

* '''Warlike:''' A Warlike ruler would save {{Iconify|Gold}} for war before invisting it to develop their realm. If they are at peace for an extended period of time, they will use their gold to build Buildings. They are more likely to create and promote heroic legends. 
** Relevant Traits: {{Iconify|wrathful}}, {{Iconify|impatient}}, {{Iconify|sadistic}}, {{Iconify|ambitious}}, {{Iconify|vengeful}}, {{Iconify|irritable}}, and {{Iconify|zealous}}.
** AI with high Boldness and Greed also tends to be Warlike.
* '''Cautious:''' A Cautious ruler would prepare for war to be declared upon them. They are more averse to declaring offensive wars, more inclined to save {{Iconify|Gold}} for defense, and invest gold for Fortifaction Buildings and Men-at-arms regiments. They are less likely to create and promote legends.
** Relevant traits: {{Iconify|patient}}, {{Iconify|calm}}, {{Iconify|craven}}, {{Iconify|paranoid}}, and {{Iconify|content}}.
** {{Iconify|fickle}} rulers would never be Cautious.
* '''Builder:''' A Builder would fund Buildings and Men-at-arms regiments as soon as they have surplus {{Iconify|Gold}}. They construct more Economic Buildings and Holdings. They only save up gold if threatened directly, such as by a strong Faction. They are more likely to create and promote legends then Cautious rulers, but less likely than Warlike ones.
** Rulers with high Boldness, inclination for building and low inclination for war tend to be Builders.
** Relevant traits: {{Iconify|calm}}, {{Iconify|patient}}, {{Iconify|diligent}}, {{Iconify|generous}}, {{Iconify|stubborn}}, {{Iconify|profligate}}, and {{Iconify|improvident}}.
** Rulers with Domain Focus also tend to be Builders.
* '''Unpredictable:''' Unpredictable rulers have no traits for any specifc archetype, and may temporarily follow any economic strategy.
* '''Conqueror:''' a ruler with the  {{Iconify|Conqueror}} trait wants to expand their realm through war at any cost. They would invest all their {{Iconify|Gold}} into the war chest or to buy Men-at-arms. They hardly ever host or go to Activities, or sponor Inspirations They only use Activities to gain {{Iconify|Prestige}} and {{Iconify|Piety}} to go to war. 
** Any non-Cautious Ruler has the potential to become a {{Iconify|Conqueror}}.

== Legends ==
[[File:Creating a legend.png|thumb|350px|A legend being created]]
{{expansion|lod}}
Legends represent important deeds that a character achieved in life. The story of the legend will be written in various events as the legend is being completed. Creating a legend costs 200 {{iconify|Gold}} if {{iconify|Count}} or {{iconify|Duke}}, 300 if {{iconify|King}} and 400 if {{iconify|Emperor}}, and it also has a monthly maintenance cost until it is completed. {{icon|legitimizing legend}} Legitimizing legends also cost 75 {{iconify|Prestige}}. A legend needs at least 5 years before it can be completed or abandoned. Each legend can only be created once.

Legends are created from Legend Seeds. The primary way of obtaining Legend Seeds is by employing a [[File:Court chronicler court position.png|24px]] Court Chronicler with high Aptitude. They can also be obtained by doing certain deeds or being part of a certain dynasty.

When created, a legend can be about either the ruler creating it or to one of its close or extended family members, living or dead, as long as they are at least 16 years old. If the protagonist is another character the ruler will gain {{green|+20}} {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if the protagonist does not have a trait considered a virtue, and {{green|+50}} if it does. Creating a legend also unlocks the Commission Legend Artifact decision.

Each legend while being created will have an [[File:Legend owner.png|24px]] Owner and may have [[File:Legend promoter.png|24px]] Promoters as well. Both will gain bonuses depending on the legend type and unlock the [[File:Spread legend intent.png|24px]] Spread Legend intent for certain activities. Additional bonuses can be obtained as the legend is created.
* [[File:Legend owner.png|24px]] Owner is the ruler who starts the legend and gains the most bonuses. If the character dies any member of the same dynasty can take ownership of the legend from the Chronicle screen.
* [[File:Legend promoter.png|24px]] Promoters are rulers that promote the legend, gaining fewer bonuses but only paying half of the maintenance cost of owning it. Promoting a legend requires one of the following:
** Know the language of the legend's creator
** Neighbor with the legend's creator
** Lover or Soulmate with the legend's creator
** Friend or Best Friend with the legend's creator

Legends come in three types and three levels of quality, which together determine what benefits they give. When a legend is created it will start at Famed quality. Once it has spread to 100 Baronies it can be upgraded to Illustrious quality and will not spread further until upgraded. Once it has spread to 300 Baronies it can be upgraded to Mythical quality and will not spread further until upgraded.

=== Historical legend seeds ===
Historical legend seeds can only be used once per game, regardless of character. They are restricted to certain dynasties, cultures or faiths.

Some historical seeds have an associated ancient culture. If the {{iconify|Royal Court}} DLC is also enabled, completing these legends will give the option to create a divergent culture with the ancient culture's cultural pillars
