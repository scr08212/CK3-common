[[File:Inventory.png|thumb|350px|Inventory artifacts]]
Artifacts are objects unique in the world that give various bonuses to the character using them and are always inherited by the primary heir. Artifacts are divided into two categories: inventory artifacts and court artifacts.
* '''Inventory artifacts''' are worn by a character via their inventory. Each character can wear up to 9 artifacts: a crown, a journal, a weapon, an armor, a regalia and 4 trinkets.
* '''Court artifacts''' are displayed in a character's royal court and thus require the Royal Court DLC. Each court can display up to 15 artifacts: 3 large wall ornaments, 3 small wall ornaments, 2 pieces of furniture, 2 book items, 4 pedestal items, and a throne.

Artifacts may be given as gifts to other characters. This will grant {{green|+20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} if the receiving character can use the artifact and {{green|+5}} {{iconify|Opinion}} if it cannot.

Inventory artifacts that are not worn as well as court artifacts can be damaged or lost if the realm capital is besieged. If an artifact is lost during a siege its previous owner will gain a claim on it. All house heads will have a claim on the Dynasty Banner of their dynasty. Having a claim allows a character to demand the return of their artifact although accepting requires sufficiently superior military strength. More importantly, artifact claims allow the claimant to use the Artifact Claim War casus belli or challenge the artifact owner to a duel for the artifact.

{{expansion|cor}}
Rulers with the [[File:Uncrowned.png|24px]] Uncrowned law cannot use [[File:Artifact regalia.png|24px]] Regalia artifacts if their religion is Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Hausa, Finno-Ugric or Slavic and cannot use [[File:Artifact crown.png|24px]] Crown artifacts if their religion is any other. But owning such an artifact is necessary to increase [[File:Activity coronation.png|24px]] Coronation activity options.

== Rarity ==
All artifacts have a Rarity, which determines the artifact's Durability, cost to repair and how much {{iconify|Gold}} is obtained if the artifact is manually destroyed.

All artifacts have a Durability, which represents the integrity of the artifact. When it reaches zero, the artifact is destroyed. If a non-historical artifact is inherited by someone who is not a close family member, it will also lose Durability. All artifacts have a quality rating that determines their Durability. All artifacts will lose 1 Durability each year except for artifacts displayed in the royal court. Durability loss can be reduced by employing an [[File:Antiquarian court position.png|24px]] Antiquarian, which also enables artifacts to be reforged. Reforging an artifact costs {{iconify|Gold}}, but will replenish its Durability. When reforging an artifact, its owner will always have the option to turn it into a Pedestal Item artifact, if it's not one already. Doing so will also change an artifact's effects. As adventurers cannot employ an [[File:Antiquarian court position.png|24px]] Antiquarian, they cannot reforge an artifact, but can still repair one.

The cost of repairing an artifact is influenced by the remaining durability. Base repair cost also depends on an internal not visible ingame value calculation, some famed artifacts will count as illustrious for repairs for example. Base repair costs in the table below are a guideline.

AI rulers will never go to war over a Common artifact.

== Creating artifacts ==
For rulers the main way of obtaining artifacts is via the ''Commission Artifact'' decision, which allows them to choose what type of artifact they want created and costs 100 {{iconify|Gold}}. While an artifact is created various events can take place, allowing the ruler to pay further to produce a higher quality artifact. Pedestal Item artifacts cannot be created this way.

For adventurers the main way of obtaining artifacts is by visiting City holdings and buying them with {{iconify|Gold}}. A Golden Coat of the Swan armor can be obtained via the Knight of the Swan decision.

The Commission Epic decision will create a Book artifact if the character has a royal court and a Journal artifact if the character does not have a royal court.

If a character wins a game of chess there is a 5% chance to gain a trinket artifact called Lucky Go Board if the character is in Eastern Asia and Lucky Chess Board if the character is somewhere else. The chance is increased to 25% if the game was played for a county. When offered, the artifact can also be destroyed to lose 10 {{iconify|Stress}} or improved for a moderate amount of {{iconify|Gold}}.

If the {{iconify|All Under Heaven}} DLC is installed, tributaries of China can obtain a Fine Seal of Investiture regalia by paying tribute while they have sufficient Imperial Grace.

If a character has a Royal Court artifacts can be obtained the following ways:
* All characters will have a House Banner large wall ornament. If they lose all {{iconify|Kingdom}} and {{iconify|Empire}} titles the character who took the last title will get the artifact but if they're not part of the same house only the Court Grandeur bonus will be given.
* Successful [[File:Activity hunt.png|24px]] Hunt activities will grant a small wall ornament.
* When a pet dies there will be the option to pay 10-20 {{iconify|Gold}} to gain a small wall ornament.
* Book artifacts can be obtained via the University Visit activity.
* If a character wins a battle against a Noble opponent there is a chance to gain a Warbanner large wall ornament. Alternatively the artifact can be destroyed to gain 75 {{iconify|Prestige}}.
* If a character has the {{iconify|Arbitrary}}, {{iconify|Deceitful}}, {{iconify|Callous}}, {{iconify|Sadistic}} or {{iconify|Vengeful}} trait executing a prisoner has a 25% chance to be offered a Skull pedestal item. If the prisoner was a Nemesis the option will always be given. If the ruler does not have an [[File:Executioner court position.png|24px]] Executioner it will lose {{red|-30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the Personal Physician or Antiquarian.
* If the {{iconify|All Under Heaven}} DLC is installed, all independent rulers with {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Ritsuryō}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}} and {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} government will have an Imperial Seal pedestal item.
* If the {{iconify|Friends and Foes}} DLC is installed, when a nemesis dies characters with the {{iconify|Callous}}, {{iconify|Sadistic}} or {{iconify|Vengeful}} trait can gain a Skull Goblet pedestal item. The option will not be available if the nemesis' faith has the Sky Burials funerary tradition.

=== Inspirations ===
{{expansion|roc|rtp}}
Landless characters occasionally gain an Inspiration, allowing them to work on creating an artifact. Characters older than 13 can sponsor the inspirations with {{iconify|Gold}}, with the cost depending  on how skilled the inspired character is. Once an inspired character is financed they will start working on the artifact. The artifact's effects will depend on the inspired character's traits. The artifact quality is decided by an average of the relevant skills plus modifiers from some cultures, buildings or events. There are two ways for characters to gain inspirations:
* Inspired characters can randomly appear in royal courts. The greater a court's Grandeur the higher the chance that an inspired character will appear.
* Followers of adventurers who have the Inspiration is Everywhere lifestyle perk can randomly gain inspirations.

There are multiple types of Inspiration, which determine what type of artifact will be created. If an inspiration can create more than one type of artifact there's a small chance the sponsor will be allowed to choose what sort of artifact they want created.

=== Travels journal ===
{{expansion|rtp}}
Adventurers can take the ''The Travels of [adventurer name]'' decision to create a Journal artifact with the same name. Based on the number of points of interest visited, the artifact will give the following:
{| class="mildtable plainlist" style="text-align: center;"

|-
| '''60+''' || {{green|+40%}} || <span style="color:purple;">'''Illustrious'''</span>
|}

=== Icons ===
{{expansion|rtp}}
Icons are artifacts that can be created via the ''Commission Icon'' decision. There are three artifact options to choose from when taking the decision:

All characters can choose to create a Trinket artifact. For landed rulers the artifact will have {{green|Masterwork}} rarity and provide {{green|+0.3}} or {{green|+0.4}} monthly {{iconify|Piety}}. For landless rulers there is a small chance the artifact will have <span style="color:brown;">'''Common'''</span> rarity and provide {{green|+0.1}} or {{green|+0.2}} monthly {{iconify|Piety}}.

Rulers with a royal court an choose to create a Large Wall Ornament or Small Wall Ornament artifact. The artifact will have two of the following bonuses:
* {{icon|piety}} Monthly piety
* {{icon|gold}} Temple holding and building construction cost reduction
* {{icon|gold}} Zealot vassal tax contribution
* {{icon|opinion}} Zealot vassal opinion
* {{icon|opinion}} Clergy opinion

== Historical artifacts ==
Historical artifacts have mostly fixed effects. If they are lost or the required title does not exist in the chosen start date they may be discovered randomly through Adventure inspirations. If a character obtains an artifact it lacks the requirements to use only the Court Grandeur bonus will be given. Artifacts that need a certain religion can be used if the faith has the syncretism tenet for the required religion.

==== Holy relics ====
Holy relics are adventure artifacts restricted to a certain religion. They can also be found outside their historical region in counties belonging to that religion. If a character has a holy relic from a different religion then all characters of that religion will gain a casus belli to recover the relics. Buying a claim of a holy relic costs {{iconify|Piety}} instead of {{iconify|Prestige}}.

=== Coronation artifacts ===
{{expansion|cor}}
Every starting independent {{iconify|King}} and {{iconify|Emperor}} with the exception of the Byzantine and Holy Roman emperors will start with an artifact.

== Mummification artifacts ==
{{expansion|roc}}
If a Faith has the Mummification funerary tradition, Furniture artifacts can be created after a {{iconify|Funeral}} activity. When the activity concludes there are three options: take the whole mummy to the court, which creates a Mummy artifact, take only the heart, which creates a Heart artifact, or leave the mummy in the tomb to gain additional {{iconify|Piety}}. All artifacts require the faith to have the doctrine and give {{green|+0.2}} monthly {{iconify|Prestige}} otherwise.

The rarity of the artifact is determined by the history of the deceased. The rarity is increased by various factors like: the number of Virtuous Traits, Highest Title held, was the deceased the Head of Faith, Pilgrim trait (if the Faith allowed Pilgrimages), did they participate in a Tourney, every Lifestyle Trait, and if they had a max level education Trait. It is reduced by Sinful traits. And lastly the Saint and Living Legend traits increase the final score by 50%.<!-- for more info on these calculations see 00_artifact_values.txt-->
