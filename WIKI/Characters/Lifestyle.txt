[[File:Lifestyles.png|thumb|350px|The 6 lifestyles]]
The '''lifestyle''' represents a character's choice of which [[skill]] the [[character]] will devote his or her time honing. There are 6 lifestyles to choose from, each containing 3 focuses and 3 perk trees. Characters gain lifestyle experience over time, but can also gain it through many events throughout the game.

Once a lifestyle is chosen a character can receive random events related to its focuses. While most events are related to the currently selected focus, events from other focuses within the same lifestyle can take place as well.

== Focuses ==
Each lifestyle contains 3 focuses, each one granting various bonuses to the character. All focuses grant {{green|+25}} monthly experience towards the character's lifestyle, which can further be improved by the character's education and other factors. A character's focus can be changed once every 5 years. Characters must have a playable government or be heirs to gain lifestyle experience.

The [[File:Wandering lifestyle.png|24px]] Wandering lifestyle requires the {{iconify|Wandering Nobles}} DLC.

=== Education focuses ===
[[File:Education focuses.png|thumb|200px|The education focuses for a character with the Charming trait]]
Education focuses are available to characters between the age of 6 and 9 and grant the character {{green|+1}} in the matching skill. When the character becomes an adult they will gain an education trait. The level of the education trait depends on both how well the character's childhood trait matched with the education focus, and the quality of their guardian, if they were assigned one. Players can change the education focus of their children, as well as their own if they are one. The education focus can only be changed once in both cases.

== Perk trees ==
Each lifestyle has 3 perk trees, each one containing 9 perks. Each perk costs 1000 experience to unlock and the final perk in each tree always gives a powerful trait. Both perks and 6 unique traits can be obtained through lifestyle events. A perk can only be unlocked if all perks above have been unlocked.

On average a new perk is unlocked every few years. A character can reset all lifestyle perks once per lifetime at the cost of 100 {{iconify|Stress}}, which is affected by Stress Gain modifiers. Resetting the perks will also remove any final trait.

Rulers and adventurers use different sets of perk trees. All unlocked perks will convert to the ruler/adventurer variant if an adventurer becomes a ruler and vice versa.
