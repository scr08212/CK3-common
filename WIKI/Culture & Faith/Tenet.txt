== Syncretism ==
All faiths can pick a Syncretism tenet, which borrow at least one virtue and sin from another religion, allow the faith to use artifacts restricted to that religion, grants {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} mutually with all characters and counties following it, and makes their faiths unable to be considered or consider the current faith Evil. Each faith can have only one Syncretism tenet.

Dharmic Syncretism will consider eastern faiths astray instead of hostile and vice versa.

If a faith has a Syncretism tenet and attempts to convert a county whose Faith matches it, the [[File:Task conversion.png|24px]] County Conversion Speed is reduced by {{red|−25%}}.
