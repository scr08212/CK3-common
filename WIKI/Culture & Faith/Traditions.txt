{{Version|1.17}}
'''Traditions''' represent the main customs of a [[culture]] and can grant various effects. A culture can have up to 5 traditions in the tribal era, with every additional era reached granting an additional slot for Traditions. Adding a tradition costs 2000 {{iconify|Prestige}}, which may be increased by the following:
* {{red|+2000}} if the culture does not have one of the Tradition's preferred [[Culture#Ethos|ethos]].
* {{red|+3000}} if optional requirement is not fulfilled. This does not apply to AI Culture Heads.

In the Royal Court DLC replacing a tradition increases the final cost by {{red|+50%}} and the time it takes to establish it by {{red|+25%}}.
The needed time to establish a tradition is dependent on the number of counties with that culture. The fewer counties the culture has, the faster it goes. The maximum time to establish a tradition is 30 years.

It should be noted that many traditions are mutually exclusive with other traditions. The only way to bypass this restriction is through hybridization with a culture that has the other tradition.
