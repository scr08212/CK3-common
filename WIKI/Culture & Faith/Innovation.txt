'''Innovations''' represent technological, legal and ideological advances that a [[Culture]] can make. Once an innovation is unlocked, it can be used by any County and Character of the culture which unlocked it. Innovations are grouped into 4 categories: Military and Civic, Cultural, and Regional. The {{iconify|All Under Heaven}} DLC adds a fifth category - Silk Road.
* Military and Civic innovations have a small chance to progress towards being unlocked each month based on multiple factors, the most important being average Development in Counties of the Culture. The second most important factor is the number of neighbor Counties that belong to another Culture which already unlocked an innovation (Exposure). The advancement chance is 5% + Fascination % + 40% if the innovation is the current exposure.
** The Culture Head of each culture can choose one innovation at a time to be that culture's Fascination.  The Fascination bonus is 20% as a base, plus 1% per the Culture Head's skill that matches the innovation's.  With the Scientific perk, these numbers go up to 27% base and 1.35% per the Culture Head skill.
** Each culture will also have Exposure to one innovation at a time, picked from among innovations discovered by cultures adjacent and/or sharing religion with the culture.  The innovation with Exposure is determined automatically, and cannot be controlled by any character. The Exposure bonus is 40%.
* Regional innovations are unlocked when the Culture has a sufficient presence in a certain Region, and remain unlocked even if said territory is lost.
* Cultural innovations are always active, but require a certain culture or tradition.
* Silk Road innovations are initially available only to Han culture. After Han culture researches them, cultures with Chinese heritage, the Sinophilic tradition or a ruler who controls a hub in a Silk Road situation region with the innovation can research these innovations as well. Other rulers must unlock them by taking the Visit a Silk Road Market decision and passing the skill challenge.

Amount of advancement gained = 0.3 + (average cultural province Development * 0.02) + 0.2 if ahead in era.

Random Innovations by decisions like [[Unite the Slavs]] are decided by the in-game date.

== Eras ==
Each Culture will be within one of 4 Eras which determine which innovations the Culture can unlock. Once at least 8 innovations from an Era are unlocked and the required minimum year is reached, the Culture will slowly progress to the next Era based on the average {{iconify|Development}} in the Culture's counties. If the minimum year is not yet reached innovations from the next era can still be selected by Culture Heads as Fascination but the progress will be much slower.

Rulers with {{iconify|Tribal}}, {{iconify|Nomadic}} or {{iconify|Wanua}} government cannot use innovations later than Tribal Era ones and if a Culture Head has such a government its culture cannot progress to another Era.
