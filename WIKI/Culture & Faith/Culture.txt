[[File:Culture example.png|thumb|300px|Mashriqi culture]]
The culture represents the customs and technologies that a character or county uses. Rulers can change a county's culture by ordering their Steward to complete the {{iconify|Promote Culture}} task.

Counties will have lowered popular opinion with their direct Liege if they belong to a different culture and especially heritage. Characters can avoid this by granting the county title to a vassal of the same heritage as the target county.

A ruler can convert to the culture of their Realm Capital at the cost of {{iconify|Prestige}}, provided that their [[Council|Court Chaplain]] endorses them. Every close family member sharing the ruler's culture will adopt the new culture. Vassals sharing the ruler's culture that own counties with the new culture can decide to adopt it as well.

Depending on their culture, rulers are called by various linguistic titles which are known as their [[Form of Address]].

== Culture head ==
Each culture with at least one ruler has a Culture Head. The Culture Head is always the adult character who owns the most counties of said culture but if the {{iconify|Khans of the Steppe}} DLC is installed for some cultures the Culture Head is the character who has the most {{iconify|Herd}} unless a ruler without {{iconify|Nomadic}} government has greater military strength.

Culture Heads can choose an [[Innovation]] to become a Cultural Fascination, which will improve its discovery progress by {{green|+20%}}, with an additional {{green|+1%}} per cultural head skill that matches the innovation's. The cultural fascination can be changed at any time.

Culture Heads can reform their culture by adding new [[traditions]] if empty tradition slots are available or replacing existing ones at additional cost. If the Royal Court DLC is enabled, all rulers can hybridize their culture with another provided they meet the criteria. Adding traditions and reforming a culture takes a number of years to come into effect, depending on the number of said culture's counties. AI Culture Heads may add traditions, but will not directly replace one tradition with another. If a culture head is of a monogamous faith with a spiritual head of faith, the culture head may be given the option to remove Concubinage or Polygamy from their culture at the request of the head of faith via event.

== Cultural acceptance ==
Cultural Acceptance determines how much {{iconify|Opinion}} penalty two cultures have towards each other. For every culture the culture with the highest Cultural Acceptance will be selected for Culture Spread, which increases the speed at which progress is gained towards an innovation the culture doesn't know but the other culture does by {{green|+40%}}. If the Royal Court DLC is enabled, it also determines whether two cultures of different heritage can create a hybrid culture. The baseline acceptance between two cultures will be the following:
*{{green|+20}} if both cultures share the same heritage
*{{green|+10}} if both cultures share the same language
*{{green|+10}} if both cultures share the same [[Culture#Ethos|ethos]] and are located within the same geographic region
*{{green|+5}} if most counties of both cultures share the same [[religion]]
*{{green|+10}} if most counties of both cultures share the same [[faith]]
*{{green|+5}} if most counties of both cultures have an [[Faith#List_of_eastern_faiths|eastern faith]]
*{{green|+10}} if most counties of both cultures have pluralistic faiths and are located within the same geographic region

== Cultural pillars ==
Each culture has 5 cultural pillars: Heritage, Language, Aesthetics, Martial Custom and Ethos.
* {{iconify|Heritage}} represents a culture's origin and prevents creating hybrid cultures if both cultures share it.
* {{icon|language}} Language represents the language that all characters and counties of a culture speak, and determines the default birth names, as well as the title naming and what the culture's knights are called. If a character converts to a culture with a different language, they will instantly learn it.
* [[File:Aesthetics.png|24px]] Aesthetics determine the naming practices as well as the appearance of architecture, armies, clothes and coat of arms.
* {{icon|equal}} Martial Custom determines what genders can act as Commanders and Knights and requires the Royal Court DLC. Without it the faith's View on Gender doctrine determines it.

===Ethos===
Each culture will have an ethos, which represents the core values, principles and attitude towards life that the culture has. It also determines which [[Royal court#Court type|court types]] are available. In the Royal Court DLC, reforming a culture's ethos costs 20000 {{iconify|Prestige}}.

== Traditions ==
{{main|Traditions}}
Each culture has several traditions, which represent the main customs of a culture and can grant various effects. A culture can have up to five traditions in the tribal era, with every additional era reached granting an additional slot for Traditions. 
The base cost of adding a tradition is 2000 {{iconify|Prestige}}, which may be increased by the following:
* {{red|+2000}} if the culture does not have one of the Tradition's preferred ethos.
* {{red|+3000}} if the Tradition's optional requirement is not fulfilled. This does not apply to AI Culture Heads.

In the Royal Court DLC replacing a tradition increases the final cost by {{red|+50%}} and the time it takes to establish it by {{red|+25%}}.

The needed time to establish a tradition is dependent on the number of counties with that culture. The fewer counties the culture has, the faster it goes. The maximum time to establish a tradition is 30 years.

Many traditions are mutually exclusive with other traditions. The only way to bypass this restriction is through hybridization with a culture that has the other tradition.

== New cultures ==
There are two ways through which a new culture can be formed, both of which cost {{iconify|Prestige}}.

=== Hybrid cultures ===
{{expansion|roc|kos}}
Hybrid cultures gain all innovations known by either culture and will start with 100% Cultural Acceptance with both parents cultures. By default hybrid cultures will be given the name of their parent cultures connected by a hyphen, though some hybrids have custom names by default. Their default color will be a mix of the parent cultures' colors. There are three ways to create a hybrid culture:
* If two cultures meet the Cultural Acceptance threshold and a ruler has counties of both cultures within their realm. Depending on game settings it might also require both cultures to be old enough. The hybrid culture can choose heritage, cultural pillars, traditions and aesthetics from either parent culture. The cost of creating a hybrid culture decreases based on the current Cultural Acceptance between the two parent cultures. The size of the hybrid culture will depend on how much Cultural Acceptance has been built when creating the hybrid culture. The Promote Culture steward task will have its efficiency increased for a few years in counties belonging to either parent culture.
* If a ruler does not share the culture of their realm capital and the two cultures meet the requirements to create a hybrid culture is a 5% chance each year that the ruler will be given the option to create a hybrid culture. While it is free it does not allow its pillars or traditions to be customized and are chosen at random from the two parent cultures. The hybrid culture creation can be canceled and doing so will grant {{green|+5%}} Cultural Acceptance. This sort of hybridization cannot take place if either culture has the Staunch Traditionalists tradition.
* Rulers with {{iconify|Nomadic}} government can create hybrid cultures via a decision but it does not allow its pillars or traditions to be customized and they are chosen at random from the two parent cultures.
The base threshold for Cultural Acceptance is 40%, but this can be modified by several factors, including the [[Traditions]] of the two cultures, the {{Iconify|Way of the Nomad|link=Traits}} trait, and certain [[Struggle]] contexts.

=== Divergent cultures ===
{{expansion|roc}}
Divergent cultures can be created at any point. Ethos can be freely changed. Language can be changed as long as a culture that has the target language as a pillar occupies at least 10% of the realm's counties, borders the character's culture, and has at least 25% acceptance of it (each condition can be met by a different culture that has the target language as a pillar). Martial Custom can be changed as long as the gender succession law favors the same gender. Aesthetics cannot be changed unless creating a culture divergence that took place historically. Traditions can be changed for a cost. The base cost of creating a divergent culture depends on how little of the original culture the ruler causing the divergence controls. Newly created divergent cultures gain a conversion bonus in counties of the original culture for 50 years.

==List of cultures==
Culture divergences that take place after the start date can be stopped by a player who controls 80% of the counties from the original culture.
* Iberian architecture will have Mediterranean appearance and Iberian fashion will have Continental European appearance if the {{iconify|Fate of Iberia}} DLC is not installed.
* Iranian architecture will have Arabic appearance, Iranian fashion will have Arabic appearance, and Turkic Fashion will have Mongolian appearance if the {{iconify|Legacy of Persia}} DLC is not installed.
* Byzantine architecture will have Mediterranean appearance and Byzantine fashion will have Mediterranean appearance if the {{iconify|Roads to Power}} DLC is not installed. Constantinople will also use a unique appearance if the DLC is installed.

=== Nomadic cultures ===
Nomadic cultures are located in nomadic regions. Counties with nomadic cultures will use the most common architecture of the region where they're located. If the {{iconify|Khans of the Steppe}} DLC is installed all of them will use {{iconify|Herd}} to determine their culture head and will lose the Horse Lords and Steppe Tolerance traditions.

=== North Germanic cultures ===
There are four cultures with North Germanic heritage. Their Culture Head will always be the ruler who controls most counties of that culture. Between the years 950 and 990 the Norse culture split will take place. All Norse counties and characters inside Norway will become Norwegian, all Norse counties and characters inside Denmark will become Danish, and all Norse counties and characters inside Sweden, Finland and Sápmi will become Swedish. The split can be prevented by a ruler who controls 80% of the counties with Norse culture when it happens. Norse architecture will have Continental European appearance and Norse fashion will have Northern European appearance if the {{iconify|Northern Lords}} DLC is not installed.

=== Ancient cultures ===
Ancient cultures are all dead and only exist for the purpose of Legends and historical characters. They can be selected for custom characters but do not start with any Innovation. If they are brought back on the map, their Culture Head will be the ruler who controls most counties of that culture.

== Harrying of the North ==
{{expansion|rtp}}
Harrying of the North is a culture mechanic enabled if Duke William II of Normandy wins his starting war against King Harold II Godwineson of England. If playing as Hereward the Wake it will only happen if you choose to travel to England after William wins the war.

Once the Harrying of the North begins, every county belonging to a vassal of King William of Anglo-Saxon culture will gain {{green|+25}} {{iconify|Control}} but also {{red|-0.25}} Monthly {{iconify|Development}} for 15 years. King William will gain the Ruthless Conqueror modifier for 15 years, which has the following effects:
* {{icon|dread}} {{green|+0.2}} Monthly Dread
* {{icon|control}} {{green|+0.5}} Monthly Control
* {{icon|opinion}} {{red|-15}} Popular Opinion
* {{icon|opinion}} {{red|-30}} Minority Vassal Opinion
* {{icon|opinion}} {{red|-45}} Anglo-Saxon Opinion

Harrying of the North has two values to keep track of which are affected by events: Resistance and Pacification. It will start at 5 Resistance and 0 Pacification. Resistance and Pacification come in four levels and whichever value is higher will impart its effects:
{| class="mildtable"
! !! Level 1 !! Level 2 !! Level 3 !! Level 4
|-
! Resistance
| If Resistance is above 7
* {{red|-1}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
| If Resistance is above 10
* {{red|-2}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
* Slightly increased chance of Claimant factions against the king of England
| If Resistance is above 13
* {{red|-5}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
* Increased chance of Claimant factions against the king of England
* {{red|-10}} Control every 3 years in all counties of vassals of king of England
| If Resistance is above 16
* {{red|-10}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
* Greatly increased chance of Claimant factions against the king of England
* {{red|-20}} Control every 3 years in all counties of vassals of king of England
|-
! Pacification
| If Pacification is above 5
* {{green|+1}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
| If Pacification is above 8
* {{green|+2}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
* {{green|+1}} Monthly Dread for the king of England
| If Pacification is above 11
* {{green|+5}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
* {{green|+2}} Monthly Dread for the king of England
| If Pacification is above 14
* {{green|+10}} Monthly Cultural Acceptance between Anglo-Saxon and Norman cultures
* {{green|+3}} Monthly Dread for the king of England
* Unlocks the Embrace English Culture decision
|}

Harrying of the North can end in three ways. All of them will give the king of England {{green|-65}} {{iconify|Stress}}.
* If none of the vassals of the king of England has Anglo-Saxon culture or is a {{iconify|Duke}}
* If the king of England does not have Norman or English culture
* If 50 years pass
