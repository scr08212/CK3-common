{{Version|1.17}}{{Buildings nav}}
Each Holding has access to a number of '''buildings'''. Regular buildings primarily focus on increasing taxes and levies, with some secondary effects such as increasing fortifications or increasing supply, and can be upgraded once the required level of Development is reached. Only one building may be constructed or upgraded at a time in any Holding. Buildings can be constructed by a Baron, their direct Liege, or any Liege higher in hierarchy, but can only be replaced by the Baron.

Buildings can also be converted into another building at full price cost with the new building starting always as level 1. Conversions can only be initiated by the direct holder of the barony.

== Construction ==
[[File:County menu buildings highlighted.png|400px|thumb|right|A screenshot of the county menu with buildings highlighted.]]
Each Holding has a limited number of slots to construct buildings. County capitals have 2 building slots and other baronies have 1. The number of building slots can be increased by 1 by each of the following innovations:
* {{iconify|Ledger}}
* {{iconify|Bailiffs}}
* {{iconify|Guilds}}
* {{iconify|Windmills}}
Unlocked building slots are not lost if the county's culture is changed to one that has fewer building slots innovations.

The majority of buildings come in 8 levels and need the same innovation as the holding level they require. Certain traditions allow buildings to be constructed one holding level earlier.
* Level 1 buildings cost 150 {{iconify|Gold}}
* Level 2 buildings cost 250 {{iconify|Gold}}
* Level 3 buildings cost 340 {{iconify|Gold}} and a level 2 holding
* Level 4 buildings cost 500 {{iconify|Gold}} and a level 2 holding
* Level 5 buildings cost 750 {{iconify|Gold}} and a level 3 holding
* Level 6 buildings cost 1110 {{iconify|Gold}} and a level 3 holding
* Level 7 buildings cost 1600 {{iconify|Gold}} and a level 4 holding
* Level 8 buildings cost 2240 {{iconify|Gold}} and a level 4 holding

=== Oath buildings ===
{{expansion|cor}}
Oath buildings can only be constructed by rulers who swore an oath to provide for the people and only inside their domain. After the oath is completed new buildings of this type cannot be constructed until the next owner makes the same oath. Building or upgrading oath buildings takes 3 years and they do not have any holding requirements.
