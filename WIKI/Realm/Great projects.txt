Great projects are massive undertakings of independent rulers that call on all the resources in the realm. A great project begins with a starting cost which the ruler must pay. At this point the project can be canceled and the starting cost will be refunded. Afterwards the either the ruler or its subjects must pay all mandatory contributions and once the first contribution has been paid the project can no longer be canceled. Once all mandatory contributions are paid the project will take a number of years to be completed. Until the great project is halfway completed additional optional contributions can still be paid. The ruler who pays for a contribution receives a reward. Before a great project is started the sum of all mandatory contribution costs will be displaced.

Any vassal in the de jure hierarchy that holds a title covering the location where a great project is taking place can pay for the contribution, which will give them {{green|+35}} {{iconify|Prestige}} and {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Influence}}. If the vassal has the {{iconify|Governor}} trait it will receive experience for it, and if its government uses {{iconify|Merit}} it will gain some. Vassals that can afford to pay a contribution can also be asked to pay by the top liege, in which case the vassal will not receive anything and will have to accept. Vassals who benefit from the great project will always accept but those who do not must be convinced. Acceptance can be increased by offering the vassal {{iconify|Influence}} or a Hook. A {{iconify|Weak Hook}} on the vassal can also be used to increased their acceptance while a {{iconify|Strong Hook}} can be used to force them to accept.

Great projects are canceled if the project location is conquered by a different ruler.

== Develop Communities ==
Develop Communities is a great project available to rulers with {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative, {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Ritsuryō}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}} or {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} government. The Hegemon of China also requires to have filled the Minister of Works council position. The project must target a duchy and when completed every county inside will gain {{iconify|Development}} and every holding in them will gain or upgrade a random building. The project takes 10 years to complete. The cost of the great project scales with the ruler's {{iconify|Treasury}} income.
Every subject can contribute to the great project, which has two mandatory contributions:
* '''Send Construction Crew''' costs 100 {{iconify|Treasury}} and gives the ruler who paid it 60 {{iconify|Merit}} if their government uses it and 350 {{iconify|Prestige}} if it does not
* '''Provide Engineers''' costs 100 {{iconify|Treasury}} and gives the ruler who paid it 60 {{iconify|Influence}}
The great project has one optional contribution, which can only be paid by the governor of the selected duchy. The contribution costs 400-800 {{iconify|Treasury}} depending on the culture's era and increases the {{iconify|Development}} in the governor's capital by 1 and gives them experience for the {{iconify|Governor}} trait.

== Capital Temple Complex ==
Capital Temple Complex is a great project available to independent rulers with {{iconify|Mandala}} government. When the great project is completed the ruler will gain 350 {{iconify|Prestige}}, 100 {{iconify|Legitimacy}} and 150 {{iconify|Renown}} and the realm capital holding will either be changed to [[File:Holding temple citadel.png|24px]] Temple Citadel or its Capital Temple Complex building will be upgraded. Starting the great project costs 250 {{iconify|Piety}} for each level. The project can be taken multiple times for each realm capital but there is a limit of two Capital Temple Complex building for every de jure kingdom.

Every subject can contribute to Capital Temple Complex great projects, but those who also have an upgraded Temple Complex will always refuse and have to be forced to contribute. Resource rewards from contributions are given to the ruler who paid for them but modifiers are always given to the top liege.
