Travel is used for characters on the road who must leave their home for a time. The system is used by any activity that does not take place in the same barony as the character, as well as vassals who make the decision to petition or pay homage to their liege. [[Adventurer]]s also travel is also used while undertaking [[Adventurer#Contracts|contracts]] or moving their camp.

In most cases, a character will travel with an Entourage made up of characters relevant to the circumstances. Characters who have {{icon|court physician}} Personal Physician or {{iconify|Bodyguard}} court positions will always join and additional characters can be added via certain travel options. Schemes progress is paused if either character is traveling, unless both characters are part of the same Entourage. If a ruler's travel destination lies outside their realm, a [[Regency|regent]] will assume power until the ruler returns.

== Mechanics ==
Traveling has two important factors to keep track of:
* {{icon|travel speed}} Speed determines how fast the caravan will move compared to armies. At 100% the caravan will move at the same speed as armies.
* {{iconify|Safety}} reduces the chance of {{icon|travel danger}} Danger events.

Once a destination is selected a travel route will be created going through the shortest number of baronies. Detours can be manually added in order to avoid dangerous baronies or visit specific points of interest. While traveling, various events may occur. Each barony has a chance of triggering a {{icon|travel danger}} Danger event, which is determined by the terrain of each barony, the level of constructed holdings, the [[County#Control|Control level]] of its county, and the {{iconify|Opinion}} of each county and its title holder. Some cultural [[traditions]] can reduce the danger from traveling through certain types of terrain. If a Barony is infected by a [[plague]] it will also have a Plague Danger, representing the chance of catching a plague if traveling through that barony.

== Points of interest ==
When a travel is planned the map will display all points of interest, which are baronies that contain something noteworthy. Visiting a point of interest will give additional bonuses, which stacks if the barony meets multiple point of interest criteria. The following baronies are points of interest:
* Capitals of a {{iconify|Kingdom}} will give experience to the lifestyle matching its court type. If it does not have a royal court it will give [[File:Diplomacy lifestyle.png|24px]] Diplomacy lifestyle experience.
* Capitals of an {{iconify|Empire}} will give triple experience to the lifestyle matching its court type. If it does not have a royal court it will give [[File:Diplomacy lifestyle.png|24px]] Diplomacy lifestyle experience.
* Capitals of a ruler with an Illustrious or Mythical legend will give [[File:Diplomacy lifestyle.png|24px]] Diplomacy lifestyle experience.
* Holy sites will give 100 {{iconify|Piety}}. If the character has the {{iconify|Wise Man}}/Woman trait it will also gain experience for it.
* Baghdad, Constantinople and Rome if they are outside the realm will give experience for the {{iconify|Traveler}} trait and offer the option to delay the travel for 14 days for the chance to gain various bonuses.
* Alexandria and Halicarnassos will give 150 {{iconify|Prestige}}.
* Unique buildings such as mining sites, modified natural features, and so on grant experience for the appropriate lifestyle.

=== Battles sites ===
Battle sites are points of interest that will give [[File:Martial lifestyle.png|24px]] Martial lifestyle experience and has a 20% chance to give a commander trait if the character does not have two or more. The following historical battle sites exist, provided the game is started after their historical year:
