{{Version|1.17}}
A '''Count''' is a character who controls at least one '''County'''. It is the second title rank available and the lowest rank that is playable. On the map, the territory of a county will contain multiple [[Barony|Baronies]] and cannot be altered. Each county belongs to a de jure [[Duchy]], which also cannot be changed.

== Popular opinion==
'''Popular Opinion''' represents the sentiment of the populace towards the county's direct owner. If Popular Opinion is negative, Populist or Peasant Factions can form in the County.

Each county has a culture and faith. If the ruler who owns the county title has a different faith, it will lose up to {{red|-45}} Popular Opinion depending on faith hostility and the county's faith's {{iconify|Fervor}}. If the ruler who owns the county title has a different culture, it will lose up to {{red|-15}} Popular Opinion depending on Cultural Acceptance and whether they speak the county's culture's language.

A county's culture and faith can be converted by assigning the relevant [[Council#Council_task|Councilor Task]]. Note that the conversion has to be completed in one sitting; progress will be lost if the councilor assigned to the conversion task is reassigned to another task or County.

Offensive wars that last more than 6 months add {{red|-0.5}} Popular Opinion. This modifier will gradually decay at {{green|+0.5}} per month after the war ends. If another offensive war is started before the penalty decayed completely, there is no grace period and the penalty will begin to accumulate immediately.

== Control ==
'''Control''' represents the power a landed Count has over their County and ranges from 0 to 100. It can be decreased from events, baronies being captured in sieges (unless title holder has ''Enduring Hardships'' perk), or being forcefully seized ({{red|-75}}). Control increases at a rate of {{green|0.1}} per month and can be increased faster with the [[File:Task increase control.png|24px]] Increase Control in County councilor task.

Every point of Control below 100 brings the following penalties:
* {{icon|gold}} {{red|-1%}} Tax 
* {{icon|levies}} {{red|-0.5%}} Levies
* {{icon|danger}} by {{red|+0.6%}} Danger
* {{icon|county fertility}} {{red|-1%}} County Fertility

If the title holder has the Absolute Control perk when Control is 100 it will read as ''Absolute'' and the county will provide an additional {{green|+10%}} {{icon|gold}} Taxes and {{green|+5%}} {{iconify|Levies}}.

== Development ==
'''Development''' is the measurement of technological advancement and general infrastructure in a county and ranges from 0 to 100.  Each point of development increases a county's {{iconify|Supply}} limit by {{green|+150}}. The average development of counties following a culture will affect that culture's adoption rate of [[innovations]] by {{green|0.02}} per average level.

If the county is ruled by a {{iconify|Feudal}}, {{iconify|Clan}} or {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative ruler, each point of development also provides {{green|+0.5%}} {{icon|gold}} Taxes and {{iconify|Levies}}.

Development levels of 10/20/40 or higher also give increasing penalties to the {{iconify|Hunt}} success chance in the county.

===Development growth===
Increasing county development by 1 requires accumulating 100 development growth.

Development radiates outwards from high-development counties to all other counties connected by a land route at {{green|0.1}} per difference in development level between these two counties.

Development growth can be most significantly increased via the steward's {{icon|development}} '''Increase Development in County''' task in the [[council]]. However, when performing this task an {{red|existing development}} penalty decreasing monthly development growth from it is also applied. The maximum penalty is reached at 10 development, but each era has a civic innovation that will raise the development level at which it is reached: 20, 35, 55, and finally 90. '''The steward's culture must know these innovations for them to apply''', your character's culture and the culture of the county are irrelevant ''(may not be working as intended as there is currently also a UI bug)''.

The monthly development growth from the '''Increase Development in County''' task is calculated as follows: 
*( 0.1 + 0.175 * {{icon|stewardship}} Councilor stewardship ) * (1 - ''existing development penalty'')

''existing development penalty'' is capped at 87.5%: 
*''existing development penalty'' = min( 0.875, development/100 * 9.13 * ''Innovation development'' )

''Innovation development'' applies only if your steward's culture knows the following civic innovations:
*Public Works = 0.5
*Communal Government = 0.2856
*Urbanization = 0.1818
*Renaissance Thought = 0.1111

In addition to not being able to research these innovations past tribal era, tribals also get a {{red|x0.5}} penalty to development growth increase. The penalty can be avoided by having a feudal liege, vassal or lower rank neighbor. It's not clear if it is working completely as intended.

Development can also be increased by {{green|+0.3}} monthly in your realm capital through the centralization perk in the stewardship [[lifestyle]] or by certain special [[building]]s, but it is still a fairly slow process. Development growth receives positive modifiers from economic buildings, civic [[innovation]]s (one every era for {{green|+10%}} {{icon|development}} Development Growth), the 3rd erudition [[legacy]] ({{green|+20%}} {{icon|development}} Development Growth). [[Terrain]] can provide a positive or negative modifier, same as event modifiers such as [[corruption]]. Modifiers are applied additively after the penalty has been subtracted.

== Corruption ==
'''Corruption''' includes various negative modifiers that can appear for 10 years in a County if Control falls below {{red|35%}} or the title holder is in Debt for more than 3 months. They can also be added for 5 years by the ''Collect Taxes'' councilor action if the Steward has low skill (Stewardship). A county can have up to 3 Corruption modifiers at the same time. Corruption modifiers can be removed by the Marshal task "Increase Control"; one Corruption modifier can be removed by this task immediately if Control is at 100, at the cost of {{red|-25}} Control.

Fomented Revolts is a form of corruption that can only be created by characters who have a [[File:Domicile astrologer yurt.png|24px]] Yamen Grievance Drum estate upgrade at level 3 or 4. They come in 3 levels of severity depending on how much the character who uses the interaction pays.
