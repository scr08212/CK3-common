Laws are royal decrees that have a vital effect on the development of the realm. Decreasing the level of a law is free and can be done at any point but increasing the level of a law costs {{iconify|Prestige}}.

== Authority law ==
Each realm has an authority law, which determines how much control its ruler has over the realm. Each level grants increasing powers to the ruler but also affects the {{iconify|Opinion}} of vassals. Increasing the authority level costs 10 {{iconify|Prestige}} per Realm Size, capped at 90 Realm Size and 900 {{iconify|Prestige}}, and is reduced by 11 for every point of {{iconify|Learning}}.

=== Crown authority ===
The Crown Authority law is available to {{iconify|Feudal}} and {{iconify|Clan}} governments. The law level can be increased every 20 years after researching the required innovation and has a starting cost of 100 {{iconify|Prestige}}.

There are three types of law affecting [[succession]] to a title: gender, realm and title. Changing gender or succession laws costs 500 {{iconify|Prestige}} if government is {{iconify|Feudal}}, {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative, or {{iconify|Celestial}}, and 2000 {{iconify|Prestige}} if government is {{iconify|Clan}}. It also requires all powerful vassals to either have a positive {{iconify|opinion}} of the liege, be [[Court#Prisoners|imprisoned]], or be [[Attributes#Dread|terrified]].

=== Gender law ===
The gender law determines which gender can inherit titles and claims and who can have more than one partner if its faith doctrines allow. The {{iconify|Visigothic Codes}} innovation gives access to Equal succession regardless of faith. Changing gender law requires High Crown Authority for feudal and clan realms, and only Limited Tribal Authority for tribal realms.

=== Realm succession ===
The realm succession law determines which and how many heirs will inherit the character's titles upon death. All children will gain claims on titles they did not inherit regardless of the realm succession law. Succession law cannot be changed during a regency.

==== Multiple heirs ====
The following multiple heir successions are available to {{iconify|Feudal}} and {{iconify|Sōryō}} governments.

==== Single heir ====
Single heir successions are available to most governments at the third authority level but rulers with {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative, {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} or {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} governments must be independent. {{iconify|Clan}} governments must pay an additional 1500 {{icon|piety islam}} Piety while {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative, {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} and {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} governments require the [[File:Icon influence 04.png|24px]] Authoritative level of influence to change the realm succession to single heir.

{{expansion|rtp}}
Adventurers use the '''Camp Succession''' law, which gives everything to the first valid follower among the following:
# Oldest child without any title
# Closest relative without any title
# The follower with the highest {{iconify|Prowess}}

{{expansion|auh}}
Rulers with {{iconify|Mandala}} government can only use the '''Mandala Succession''' law, which gives all titles to the oldest child allowed by the Gender Law but they will also have to pass three challenges: one from the predecessor's Mandala Aspect and two from randomly-selected aspects. The difficulty of the challenge depends on the rank of the inherited primary title. The challenge from the predecessor's Mandala Aspect can automatically be passed if the aspect was upgraded to its final level and one challenge can be automatically passed if the dynasty completed the [[File:Southeast asia legacy track.png|24px]] Divine Aspirations legacy. If the heir is imprisoned they automatically lose.
* [[File:Aspect of creation small.png|24px]] Aspect of Creation requires a {{iconify|Stewardship}} challenge
* [[File:Aspect of serenity small.png|24px]] Aspect of Serenity requires a {{iconify|Diplomacy}} challenge
* [[File:Aspect of destruction small.png|24px]] Aspect of Destruction requires a {{iconify|Martial}} challenge
* [[File:Aspect of trickery small.png|24px]] Aspect of Trickery requires an {{iconify|Intrigue}} challenge
If the heir passes the challenge it will gain a point in the skill they used.
* If the heir passes all three challenges they will not suffer any penalty
* If the heir passes two challenges they will lose 1 Level of Devotion and 100 {{iconify|Legitimacy}}
* If the heir passes one challenge they will lose 2 Levels of Devotion and 200 {{iconify|Legitimacy}}
* If the heir fails all challenges they will lose 3 Levels of Devotion and 500 {{iconify|Legitimacy}} and gain 40 {{iconify|Stress}}, all vassals either become independent or join another liege, and every {{iconify|Kingdom}} and above title is destroyed

==== Candidate succession ====
{{expansion|rtp|auh}}
Certain governments use a candidate-based succession. Every character eligible for succession has a succession score based on its skills. All noble characters in the realm can spend {{iconify|Influence}} to increase or decrease anyone's score and {{iconify|Opinion}} but there is a limit to how much they can affect the score based on the family rating. They can also ask other rulers to support the same candidate. Upon the death of the governor the family member with the highest succession score will inherit all titles and may reward the character who supported them the most if they're part of another House.

|}

==== Merit succession ====
{{expansion|auh}}
Vassals with {{iconify|Celestial}}, {{iconify|Meritocratic}} or {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} government use a candidate-based succession depending on their administration type. Every character in the realm who has the same Career Path is eligible for succession and the titles will go with the character who has the highest Merit Rank and succession score.
* Characters who have [[File:Icon game concept celestial standard administration.png|24px]] Standard, [[File:Icon game concept celestial industrial administration.png|24px]] Industrial or [[File:Icon game concept celestial metropolitan administration.png|24px]] Metropolitan administration type use the '''Appointment Succession'''. Succession score is based on overall skill.
* Characters who have [[File:Icon game concept celestial military administration.png|24px]] Military or [[File:Icon game concept celestial protectorate administration.png|24px]] Protectorate administration type use the '''Commander Succession'''. Succession score is based on {{iconify|Martial}} skill and commander traits.

==== Kurultai ====
{{expansion|kos}}
Rulers with {{iconify|Nomadic}} government use the Kurultai law, where there are no requirements besides the cost for designating a heir but what happens upon succession depends on the {{iconify|Obedience}} of the Kurultai. If all Kurultai are Obedient and the region season is not Havsarsan Zud then the realm will have a Stable Succession, where the primary heir inherits everything. The Mongol Empire will always have Stable Succession. If not all Kurultai are Obedient or the region season is Havsarsan Zud then the realm will have a Chaotic Succession, where every sibling and disobedient Kurultai favored by the gender law will gain {{iconify|Pressed Claim}}s on all of the heir's titles, all obedient Kurultai will gain {{red|-25}} {{iconify|Opinion}}, and one of the following events will happen depending on the number of disobedient Kurultai:

=== Title succession ===
Rulers who have {{iconify|Feudal}}, {{iconify|Clan}} or {{iconify|Tribal}} government and are at peace can apply a Title Succession law on duchy, kingdom or empire rank titles at the cost of 1500 {{iconify|Prestige}} each. Under Title Succession law all elector characters will vote on who will become the heir and vassals and owe allegiance to the title rather than their liege personally. Kings and emperors can also apply a Title Succession law to all top-rank titles via the Adopt Special Succession Type decision. Removing a Title Succession law costs {{iconify|Prestige}} scaling with title rank.

== Coronation ==
{{expansion|cor}}
As long as the Coronation Laws game rule has not been set to No Coronation Laws, every {{iconify|King}} and above that does not have {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} or {{iconify|Sōryō}} government will have the Coronation law. Unlike other laws, it cannot be changed manually and is instead increased automatically upon completing a [[File:Activity coronation.png|24px]] Coronation activity. Every new ruler will start with the law set to the lowest level and depending on game rules increasing the title rank to {{iconify|Empire}} or {{iconify|Hegemony}} may decrease it as well.
