[[File:Court positions.png|thumb|330px|Court positions]]
Each landed character has a court, which consists of the unlanded characters of a realm. A court may contain family members, knights, lovers, courtiers, hostages and guests.

== Courtiers ==
Courtiers are unlanded characters living at a ruler's court. They can be appointed as councilors, commanders, knights or vassals. If a courtier does not have a court position or [[minor title decision|minor title]] they have a 2% chance to leave each month. The chance is decreased by {{green|−0.1%}} for each 10 points of {{icon|opinion}} opinion above 0 and increased by {{red|+0.1%}} for each 10 points of {{iconify|opinion}} below 0. In addition the chance to leave can be modified by the following:
{| class="mildtable"
! Condition
! Chance to leave
|-

| Child
| {{green|−3%}}
|-
| Any claim
| {{green|−1%}}
|-
| {{iconify|Pregnant}}
| {{green|−1%}}
|-
| Married to the liege
| {{green|−0.5%}}
|-
| {{icon|health}} Low health
| {{green|−0.3%}}
|-
| Liege or another courtier is a friend
| {{green|−0.2%}}
|-
| Liege or another courtier is a lover
| {{green|−0.2%}}
|-
| Liege or another courtier is a close family member
| {{green|−0.2%}}
|-
| {{iconify|Bastard}}
| {{red|+0.3%}}
|-
| {{iconify|Rival}}
| {{red|+0.5%}}
|}

=== Hostages ===
Hostages are landless children that are a Close Family member of another ruler who sends them to another ruler's court as an assurance of peace or submission. Hostages can be offered, demanded or exchanged both to prevent a war or to help end it. A character having a hostage will be called its Warden and will gain the following rewards:
* {{icon|prestige}} {{green|+0.1}} to {{green|+1}} Monthly Prestige depending on difference in title rank
* {{icon|piety}} {{green|+0.1}} to {{green|+1}} Monthly Piety depending on difference in title rank if the hostage's faith is considered Hostile or Evil
* {{icon|renown}} {{green|+0.25}} to {{green|+0.5}} Monthly Renown depending on the Level of Splendor of the hostage's dynasty if they are part of a different dynasty
* When the hostage reaches the age of 16 there is a chance to gain a [[File:Hook-perpetual.png|frameless|24x24px]] Perpetual Hook on them
* If the hostage's liege declares war it will bring the option to kill the hostage and gain 10 {{iconify|Dread}} or spare it and gain 10 {{iconify|Opinion}} with the hostage

If a ruler declares war upon a Warden who has someone from their family as hostage it will lose a level of fame, 250 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 25 {{iconify|Opinion}} with all family members and suffer the following penalties for 5 years:
* {{icon|opinion}} {{red|-25}} Opinion
* {{icon|time}} {{red|-50%}} Siege Phase Time
* {{icon|damage}} {{red|-15%}} Army Damage
* {{icon|toughness}} {{red|-15%}} Army Toughness

== Guests ==
Guests are unlanded characters that stay at a ruler's court for three years and then have a monthly chance to leave. During this time they will interact with other members of the court and may take part in random [[event]]s. They can be convinced to stay permanently in the realm by being given a seat on the council, a court position or a landed or minor [[title]], or by using the [[seduction scheme]]. Guests can also be directly recruited by paying a variable amount of {{iconify|Gold}} — the base amount is 10 gold, and increases if the guest has claims, useful traits or high skills. Guests are more likely to visit a court if they have a definite reason, such as the ruler being strong enough to press their claims, or the ruler or one of its adult children being unmarried. The fewer courtiers a character has the more guests it will receive.

Unlanded characters can be asked to visit a court with the "Invite to Court" interaction. The base reluctance is {{red|-50}} and, in the base game, typically cannot be overcome without a {{icon|weak hook}} hook. With the Royal Court DLC, sufficiently high Lodging Standards make it possible to overcome the base reluctance.

If a guest with claims is about to leave, the liege will be given the option to convince the guest to stay for one year.

== Court positions ==
Court positions are specialized roles that can be granted to courtiers and direct vassals and grant increasingly powerful benefits but for rulers cost a monthly salary. Characters who are imprisoned cannot be given court positions with the exception of Executioner. A ruler must pay {{red|200}} {{iconify|Prestige}} to fire someone with a court position while an adventurer must pay {{red|25}} {{iconify|Prestige}}. If a character's court position is revoked the character will gain a decaying {{red|−30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the liege, which is removed if the character is given another court position. Court positions can be automated to either suggest the best candidate or automatically assign it.

Common and ruler court positions can perform 1-3 additional tasks, which grant it additional bonuses but also increase the salary by +0.06 per primary title rank.

Each court position has a salary in {{iconify|Gold}} and possibly {{iconify|Prestige}}, which is affected by the following:
* {{green|−75%}} if government is {{iconify|Tribal}} or {{iconify|Wanua}}
* {{green|−20%}} if culture has the Esteemed Hospitality tradition
* {{red|+10%}} if realm size is 30-59
* {{red|+20%}} if realm size is 60-89
* {{red|+40%}} if realm size is 90-199
* {{red|+60%}} if realm size is 120+
* {{red|+25%}} if culture is is the Early Medieval era
* {{red|+50%}} if culture is is the High Medieval era
* {{red|+75%}} if culture is is the Late Medieval era
* {{red|+25%}} if {{iconify|Emperor}}
{{expansion|rtp|auh}}
If the ruler's government uses the {{iconify|Treasury}} resource the salary will be paid with it instead of {{iconify|Gold}}.
{{expansion|auh}}
The owner of the {{icon|kingdom}} Chrysanthemum Throne title cannot be given court positions unless they become landed.

=== Aptitude ===
The bonuses of a court position depend on the courtier or vassal's aptitude. Aptitude goes through 5 levels, each level requiring 20 points of aptitude:
{| class="mildtable"
! Aptitude level !! Minimum points
|-
| Terrible || 0
|-
| Poor || 20
|-
| Average || 40
|-
| Good || 60
|-
| Excellent || 80
|}

{{green|+20}} Aptitude for Family members of the same culture (Culture has the Family Business tradition).

{{red|−20}} Aptitude for Vassals.

{{red|−75}} Aptitude for {{iconify|Infirm}} characters ({{red|−50}} for the [[File:Caravan master court position.png|24px]] Caravan Master, none for the [[File:Court gardener court position.png|24px]] Court Gardener).

=== Common positions ===
The following court positions are available to all characters and always join the character's entourage. Rulers must pay a salary but adventurers do not.

=== Officers ===
{{expansion|rtp}}
Officers are available to adventurer character as opposed to regular court positions. They do not have any salary and with the exceptions of Personal Physician, Caravan Master, Stooge, Bodyguard, Camp Priest and Cultural Emissary every position gives the follower +0.1 Monthly Prestige. Almost all positions require a certain building or upgrade to be constructed in the camp and only sufficiently qualified followers may be given a position. Each Officer position can only be given to one follower and each follower can only have one Officer position. 

With the Likable Boss perk a Friend will gain {{green|+15}} Aptitude and a Best Friend will gain {{green|+30}} Aptitude.
