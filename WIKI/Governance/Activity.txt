Activities are special occasions hosted by a certain character. Most activities have multiple variants to choose from. Each activity goes through a number of phases and during each phase there is a chance every 7 days for an event to happen. A character can only take part in one activity as a time and characters with the {{iconify|Incapable}} trait cannot host or join activities.

Most activities requires other characters to join. If not a single character joins the activity will be canceled and the character who started it will gain 20 {{iconify|Stress}}. AI characters will refuse to come if there is a plague in either their capital or the destination barony.

The character starting an activity is the Host and chooses a barony for the activity, with the cost depending on the barony. The map will pin the best 5 baronies for the activity but any valid barony can be selected. All characters who attend an activity must [[travel]] to the designated barony unless it's their realm capital. Each character will travel with an Entourage made up of characters relevant to the activity.

== Cost ==
The base cost to host an activity depends on host's primary title. It is then modified by various cultural, religious and event modifiers, and culture era. Lastly, costs for activity options, travel options and caravan master are added.

=== Coronation ===
{{expansion|cor}}
Coronation is a highly interactive activity that can only be held once. To have a coronation a ruler must be at least 12 years old, must have a {{iconify|Kingdom}} or above title rank, and must not have {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} or {{iconify|Sōryō}} government. Only adult characters can attend. AI rulers will always have a Coronation as soon as they can. The activity has two variants available. Which variant is available to who depends on the faith's Coronation Tradition doctrine.
* [[File:Coronation type normal icon.png|24px]] Coronation can be done in either the realm capital or a holy site within borders and is more successful if the barony meets both requirements. If the characters has {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative government they must also be independent. It will also give the host the [[File:Crowned king.png|24px]] Crowned Sovereign law unless the Coronation Laws game rule has been set to No Coronation Laws.
* [[File:Coronation type anointment icon.png|24px]] Anointment can only be done in the location where the head of faith is present and gives higher rewards. The character's Level of Devotion must be at least Faithful, they must not have the {{iconify|Excommunicated}} trait, and the activity variant must be unlocked by requesting it from the head of faith, who must accept. It will also give the host the [[File:Crowned emperor.png|24px]] Anointed Sovereign law unless the Coronation Laws game rule has been set to No Coronation Laws. When the activity ends the faith will gain {{green|+4}} {{iconify|Fervor}}.

The activity has two Activity Options. Increasing the level of the Activity Options requires the character to have a [[File:Artifact regalia.png|24px]] Regalia artifact if their religion is Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Hausa, Finno-Ugric or Slavic and a [[File:Artifact crown.png|24px]] Crown artifact if their religion is any other. At level 2 each one will give {{green|+15}} Starting Magnificence and at level 3 each one will give {{green|+25}} Starting Magnificence
* [[File:Coronation option ceremony feast type.png|24px]] Ceremony determines how likely guests are to join and at the lowest level only characters inside the realm can join
* [[File:Coronation option ceremony size.png|24px]] Celebrations determines the likelihood of certain negative events
* If both values are at least at level 2 the dynasty will gain {{green|+50}} {{iconify|Renown}} and if both values are at level 3 the dynasty will gain {{green|+100}} {{iconify|Renown}}.
Each Coronation activity has a Magnificence value, which ranges from 0 to 100 and is divided into 5 levels. The level reached at the end of the activity determines part of its rewards.

After all guests arrive, each Coronation activity can have up to 3 Major Supporters and 3 Major Detractors. Major Supporters are the most powerful guests that have positive {{iconify|Opinion}} of the host and will increase Magnificence while Major Detractors are the most powerful guests that have negative {{iconify|Opinion}} of the host and will decrease Magnificence.

While a Coronation activity is underway, factions cannot press demands but they can decrease Magnificence.

After the second stage of the coronation begins the host will receive the following rewards:
{| class="mildtable plainlist"

If 5 Coronation activities took place in the same barony, the barony will gain the [[File:Modifier legitimacy positive.png|24px]] Traditional Ascension Site modifier. If another 5 Coronation activities are held there the modifier will double and at 15 Coronations the modifier will triple.

==== Oath ====
When a Coronation activity ends the host will also have the option to swear an oath. Swearing an oath will add a decision that gives rewards if completed. The oath is canceled if the character loses its last {{iconify|Kingdom}} or higher title. 11 random oaths from the following list can be selected, provided the character meets the requirements.

Failing to fulfill an oath will increase the ruler's {{iconify|Stress}} and reduce the their {{iconify|Legitimacy}} and {{iconify|Prestige}} and {{iconify|Opinion}} with every vassal, courtier and guest. It also has a 5% chance to give the ruler the ''the Oathbreaker'' nickname.

Both the rewards for fulfilling an oath and the penalties for failing scale with the size of the character's realm and the culture's era.

=== Camp Revelry ===
{{expansion|rtp}}
Camp Revelry is an activity available only to adventurers which lasts 3 months. It has a base cost of 15 {{iconify|Gold}} and two activity options:
* [[File:Feast option food.png|24px]] Food determines the starting Carousing. Increasing it to level 2 or 3 requires a Supply Tent domicile building and can trigger events to pay {{iconify|Provisions}} and gain a either {{iconify|Piety}} or a follower.
* [[File:Tour option luxuries.png|24px]] Drinks give determine whether the guests will gain {{iconify|Opinion}} with the host how much experience the {{iconify|Eager Reveler}} trait will give. Level 2 requires a Supply Tent domicile building. Level 3 requires the [[File:Domicile building brewers.png|24px]] Mobile Brewers upgrade and gives the Master of Ceremonies modifier for 3 years at the end of the activity.
The ruler of the barony where the camp is located can be invited as a guest of honor. The chance for them to accept decreases with their primary title rank.

Camp revelries have a meter called Carousing, which ranges from 0 to 100 and decides which rewards the host will receive when the activity ends.

[[File:Charioteers UI.png|thumb|130px|The race UI next to the activity view]]

=== Chariot Race ===
{{expansion|rtp}}
Chariot Race is a highly interactive activity that can be held every 10 years in the realm capital. It is only available for adult {{iconify|Emperor}}s and above whose culture has the Roman Ceremonies tradition and is more succesful if the realm capital is Constantinople. The activity has one Activity Option: Spectacles. The option determines how much {{iconify|Legitimacy}} and {{icon|opinion}} Popular Opinion will be gained at the end of the activity, which also scales with the existing {{icon|opinion}} Popular Opinion in the realm capital. The activity can include one Honorary Guest, which will make them the target for some events to interact with them.

When the activity begins it will give {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Development}} progress to the realm capital. If the character taking the decision has {{icon|governor efficiency}} Administrative government it will also receive {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Influence}}.

In the activity will compete 4 teams: <span style="color:blue;">'''Venetoi'''</span>, {{green|Prasinoi}}, <span style="color:grey;">'''Leukoi'''</span> and {{red|Rhousioi}}. Each team will be made up of 2 or 3 characters, which will be displayed on the right. Before the race begins the characters will be sorted by the experience of their Charioteer trait.

After all guests arrive the betting will open and every character will have the option to place bets on one of the teams or place no bet. Hovering over the option to place bets will display the team's chances to win and how many guests have bet on that particular team. Once a team is selected the bet can be placed on either one of the team members or the entire team. Then the bet can be made on first place, first two places, or first three places, with the payout increasing if chances are lower. Then the amount of {{iconify|Gold}} for the bet must be selected: 50, 100, 150 or 200.

Once the race begins the window on the right will display the place in the race of every charioteer. It will also display which characters were bet on and the [[File:Charioteer court position.png|24px]] Champion Charioteer.

If the [[File:Charioteer court position.png|24px]] Champion Charioteer court position is not already filled there will be an option to spend 60 {{iconify|Influence}} and appoint one of the charioteers.

At the end of the race every contender will gain experience for the Charioteer trait in the order of their place in the race.

=== Grand Tournament ===
Grand Tournament is a highly interactive activity that can be held every 10 years in a Domain barony. It is only available for adult characters. The activity will be paid with {{iconify|Treasury}} if the host's government uses the resource and with {{iconify|Gold}} otherwise. The activity has two Activity Options:
* [[File:Tournament option accommodations.png|24px]] Accommodations determine the likelihood of certain negative events. Can choose to pay 20, 60 or 180 {{iconify|Gold}} or {{iconify|Treasury}}.
* [[File:Tournament option prizes.png|24px]] Prizes determines the quality of prize artifacts. Can choose to pay 20 (<span style="color:brown;">'''Common'''</span>), 60 (<span style="color:brown;">'''Common'''</span>-{{green|Masterwork}}), 180 ({{green|Masterwork}}-<span style="color:blue;">'''Famed'''</span>), 360 ({{green|Masterwork}}-<span style="color:purple;">'''Illustrious'''</span>) or 720 (<span style="color:blue;">'''Famed'''</span>-<span style="color:purple;">'''Illustrious'''</span>) {{iconify|Gold}} or {{iconify|Treasury}}.

When organizing a tournament one may appoint a Champion. Any rewards the Champion receives will be shared with its liege. If the organizer is participating in a Melee contest the Champion will always be part of the organizer's team. Also notably, tournaments are one of the main ways for {{iconify|Accolade}}s to gain glory.

A Grand Tournament is made up of between 1 and 5 Contests. Each character can choose whether to take part in a contest or merely observe. Taking part in a Contest has risks but will grant or improve the [[File:Trait tournament.png|24px]] Hastiluder trait, grant a positive modifier for 5 years, and winning grants an artifact. Each character has a chance to win a Contest depending on its attributes, health, and traits, particularly the [[File:Trait tournament.png|24px]] Hastiluder trait. A tournament can have the following contests:
