Adventurers are playable landless noble characters who travel the world with followers and a [[Camp]], and have a different set of [[lifestyle]] perks. As they have no steady income from landed [[titles]], adventurers primarily earn {{iconify|gold}} by completing [[#Contracts|contracts]] for landed rulers, and must stock up on {{iconify|Provisions}} in order to move the camp.

Rulers can always hire adventurers as mercenaries. This costs 30 {{iconify|Gold}} and a second payment that scales with the adventurer's contribution at the end of the war. Rulers can  also choose to expel adventurers from their realm, which prevent the adventurer from accepting contracts and gives them 3 months to leave the realm or be allowed to be imprisoned. Failing to imprison an adventurer results in a war.

== Becoming an Adventurer ==
There are a number of ways to play as an adventurer:

* Starting as a pre-scripted adventurer in any of the three start dates
* Using the [[Ruler Designer]] to create a custom adventurer
* Selecting a landless character with [[Choose a New Destiny]] on succession
* If a child far down succession asks to become an adventurer, you may switch to playing as them
* By decision for certain cultures/faiths
* Losing all landed titles

If a ruler becomes an adventurer, they lose 3 levels of fame. Aside from the player, AI characters may become adventurers; this chance is increased for those whose culture has Audacious Cadets or Sword-for-Hire traditions. Wanderers with an excess amount of {{iconify|gold}} may also decide to form an adventuring camp.

== Roll of Patrons ==
Adventurers have a Roll of Patrons, which is shown in the Camp menu. Family members, friends, lovers and rulers the adventurer has completed a regular contract for, will be added to the Roll of Patrons. Rulers on the Roll of Patrons can be asked for {{iconify|Provisions}}, {{iconify|Gold}}, {{iconify|Knight}}s, a random men-at-arms regiment, an arranged marriage, or another contract. The ''Guest of Honor'' perk also allows requesting for a {{iconify|Feast}} where the adventurer is the Honorary Guest and the ''Stalwart Leader'' perk also allows requesting for a [[File:Activity tournament.png|24px]] Grand Tournament from counts and above. Requests will reduce the {{iconify|Opinion}} of the ruler by {{red|25}} for 10 years. Only requests the patron is able to fulfill will be available and their acceptance will increase with the adventurer's level of fame.

== Adventurer armies ==
Adventurers do not have levies to raise, instead relying on men-at-arms and knights. They do not pay maintenance for their men-at-arms but they also do not reinforce over time. With the ''Take the Custom Where it Comes'' lifestyle perk, it possible to recruit men-at-arms of the culture of your current location. Regiments obtained by requests to patrons will be fully reinforced, and can be of any men-at-arms their culture has access to. 

There are a number of alternative ways to replenish them:

* When an adventurer successfully sieges a holding their men-at-arms will be replenished up to half of the holding's loot.
* Adventurers can manually replenish their men-at-arms at the cost of {{iconify|Gold}} or {{iconify|Provisions}}, or via a combined {{iconify|Diplomacy}} and {{iconify|Prowess}} challenge. 
* In holdings with Tribal government they can also be replenished at the cost of 75 {{iconify|Prestige}} per 25 soldiers for each regiment.
* In holdings with Theocracy or Holy Order government they can also be replenished at the cost of 50 {{iconify|Piety}} per 25 soldiers for each regiment.
* If the adventurer has at least 5 {{iconify|Dread}} they can also be replenished cost of 5 {{iconify|Dread}} per 25 soldiers for each regiment. The chance to successfully recruit is 2% per {{iconify|Dread}}.

By default, adventurers can only have 2 {{iconify|Knight}}s, but the number can be increased by certain camp purposes or from the Roaring Campfire building. Adventurers cannot have accolades.

Adventurers with at least one regiment can offer to join a ruler's war. If their War Contribution is sufficient when the war ends the ruler will pay them {{iconify|Gold}}. Adventurers can leave or change sides in a war they are not leading at any time but this will cost 2 levels of fame and 80 {{iconify|Stress}} and the formerly-allied war leader will become the adventurer's rival. Landed player rulers can also hire adventurers inside their realm from the Mercenaries tab but their armies are not controllable.

== Visiting holdings ==
The holding where the Camp is currently located can be visited at any either by hovering over the Camp and selecting Visit Holding or by using the decision with the same name. Once inside you can visit various places. There is no cooldown for visiting a holding but there is for actions taken within. Holdings cannot be visited if the adventurer has a disease trait.

== Gathering provisions ==
Adventurers can attempt to gather {{iconify|Provisions}} every 3 years either by hovering over the Camp and selecting Gather Provisions or by using the decision with the same name. The adventurer can use either its {{iconify|Learning}} or {{iconify|Prowess}} to determine the success chance. If the adventurer has a [[File:Chief forager camp officer.png|24px]] Chief Forager or [[File:Huntperson camp officer.png|24px]] Huntsman officer it can send them instead, with the success chance depending on the officer's aptitude.

If using {{iconify|Learning}} and the camp's barony has {{iconify|Farmlands}}, {{iconify|Floodplains}}, {{iconify|Oasis}}, {{iconify|Plains}}, or {{iconify|Wetlands}} terrain, failing has a chance to give the adventurer or officer the {{iconify|Ill}} trait. If the character already has the trait, the barony has a different terrain, or the character is using {{iconify|Prowess}}, failing has a chance to injure the character instead.

If the camp's barony is affected by winter the success chance for using {{iconify|Learning}} is decreased and failing will give the character a {{iconify|Health}} penalty for 3 years.

== Camp purpose ==
Instead of authority laws, adventurers set a camp purpose. The camp purpose affects which contracts are more common, which camp upgrades and special officers are unlocked and what events or event options the adventurers have. It also affects the appearance of characters from that camp. Changing the camp purpose costs 1000 {{iconify|Prestige}}. If the camp purpose is changed all upgrades and officers that are no longer valid will be removed but upgrades will be halfway refunded.

Legitimists is only available if the character has a {{iconify|Pressed Claim}} on a {{iconify|Kingdom}} title.

{{expansion|wnb}}
If the adventurer has the Right-Hand Man​ lifestyle perk then each camp purpose will also increase their skills.

== Camp temperament ==
[[File:Camp temperament.png|thumb|450px|Steadfast camp temperament]]
Camp temperament is dictated by the average {{iconify|Opinion}} of all followers.
* If the average {{iconify|Opinion}} of followers is {{green|40}} or more the camp temperament will be [[File:Loyalty selfless.png|24px]] Steadfast, which gives {{green|+0.4%}} {{icon|scheme success chance}} Contract Scheme Growth and {{green|+5%}} {{iconify|Toughness}} per level of fame. If the adventurer has the Absolute Control perk the it will further gain the same amount for every 20 {{iconify|Dread}}. If the adventurer has the Honored to Serve perk the it will further gain the same amount for every follower, up to a limit of 5. If the adventurer has the Camp Scientists perk the it will further gain the same amount for every follower with at least 10 {{iconify|Learning}}. Other perks can also give different bonuses rather than caps:
** Gravitas gives a scaling {{icon|scheme phase length}} Personal Scheme Phase Length bonus
** Faithful gives {{green|+5}} {{icon|advantage}} Faith Hostility Advantage
** Religious Camp gives {{green|+0.4}} {{icon|piety}} Monthly Piety per follower of the same faith
** Strength in Diversity gives {{green|+1}} to all skills for every 3 followers with different faiths
* If the average {{iconify|Opinion}} of followers is {{red|−40}} or less the camp temperament will be [[File:Loyalty self-interested.png|24px]] Mutinous, which gives {{red|+10 days}} {{icon|scheme phase length}} Contract Scheme Phase Length and {{red|−10%}} {{iconify|Damage}} per level of fame.
* If the average {{iconify|Opinion}} of followers is between {{red|−39}} and {{green|39}} the camp temperament will be [[File:Loyalty situational.png|24px]] Placated, which has no effects.

Camp temperament also plays a part in various events.

== Contracts ==
[[File:Tier 1 contract.png|thumb|250px|A contract]]

Adventurers can see Contracts on the world map, which are put there by a ruler. Contracts come in 3 tiers. Most contracts require the adventurer to [[travel]] to their barony before accepting them. Rulers will only put up contracts if they have {{iconify|Gold}} to spare.
* {{iconify|Baron}}s and {{iconify|Count}}s offer tier 1 contracts
* {{iconify|Duke}}s offer tier 2 contracts and only to adventurers with the {{iconify|Illustrious}} level of fame or above
* {{iconify|King}}s offer tier 3 contracts and only to adventurers with the {{iconify|Exalted Among Men}} level of fame or above
* {{iconify|Emperor}}s offer tier 3 contracts and only to adventurers with the {{iconify|The Living Legend}} level of fame

Additional contracts can be created using the Visit Holding decision and speaking with the town crier.

=== Regular contracts ===
Regular contracts are taken for the contractor and can have the following outcomes:
* {{green|Success}} gives {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the contractor, scaled {{iconify|Gold}}, and adds the contractor to the Roll of Patrons
* {{green|Exceptional Success}} gives {{green|+60}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the contractor, more scaled {{iconify|Gold}}, a {{iconify|Weak Hook}} on the contractor, and adds the contractor to the Roll of Patrons
* {{red|Failure}} gives {{red|-30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the contractor and {{red|-25}} {{iconify|Prestige}}
The {{iconify|Gold}} reward scales with the Contract Tier. Rulers with high Greed will pay less than those with low Greed.

=== Criminal contracts ===
Criminal contracts have a red border on the map. Both completing or failing a criminal contract will give the {{iconify|Gallowsbait}} trait and add experience for it, with successful contracts giving twice more experience. Criminal contracts can be divided into two kinds depending on whether the contract is offered for or against the contractor. Failing the contract has the same penalties as regular contracts regardless of whether it was offered for or against the contractor.

==== Contracts for the contractor ====
Contracts taken for the contractor will give {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the contractor, add a {{iconify|Weak Hook}} on them and add them to the Roll of Patrons.

=== Treasure Map ===
The Treasure Map contract has a very small chance to appear as a purchase option when visiting the town crier. If accepted the contract unlocks the Excavate Treasure decision. Taking the decision sets a destination and brings the option to travel either alone or with the camp. Once the destination barony is reached it will grant 30 {{iconify|Stress Loss}} and bring the following options:
* Finish the contract the regular way and gain {{green|50}} {{iconify|Gold}}, {{green|65}} {{iconify|Stress Loss}} and {{red|-500}} {{iconify|Provisions}}
* Finish the contract criminally gain {{green|80}} {{iconify|Gold}}, {{red|-75}} {{iconify|Prestige}} and the {{iconify|Gallowsbait}} trait and experience for it
The contract does not add anyone to the Roll of Patrons.

=== Legitimist Support ===
Legitimist Support contracts can only appear for adventurers who use the Legitimists camp purpose and can also be created via the Request Legitimist Support interaction with {{iconify|King}}s and {{iconify|Emperor}}s. Once the contract is accepted the character can negotiate up to 1800 {{iconify|Gold}} and 3000 Men-at-Arms.

The negotiation starts with 4 events, which can be increased by the following:
* +4 if any of the claimed titles is an {{iconify|Empire}}
* +1 if level of fame is {{iconify|Illustrious}}
* +2 if level of fame is {{iconify|Exalted Among Men}} or {{iconify|The Living Legend}}
* +1 if level of devotion is {{iconify|Devoted Servant}} and contractor has the same faith
* +2 if level of devotion is {{iconify|Paragon of Virtue}} or {{iconify|Religious Icon}} and contractor has the same faith
* +1 if level of splendor is {{iconify|Noteworthy}}
* +2 if level of splendor is {{iconify|Reputable}}
* +3 if level of splendor is {{iconify|Well-known}} or above
* One of the next four options:
** +4 if the character passes an {{iconify|Intrigue}}, or {{iconify|Diplomacy}} challenge in the prelude event, -1 if the challenge fails.
** +4 if you are friends with the ruler. Also adds a level of support.
** +2 levels of support if a hook is used, no additional turns.

The contract will offer 300 {{iconify|Gold}} and an army of 200 {{icon|archers}} Retinue Archers, 200 {{icon|heavy infantry}} Retinue Vanguard and 50 {{icon|heavy cavalry}} Retinue Lancers in exchange for paying half of the annual tax income for 2 years after gaining the claimed titles. You can ask for more, and each time it will add another 300 {{iconify|Gold}},200 {{icon|archers}} Retinue Archers, 200 {{icon|heavy infantry}} Retinue Vanguard and 50 {{icon|heavy cavalry}} Retinue Lancers but will increase the number of years you have to pay half of your annual tax income by 1. You can also do a {{iconify|Diplomacy}} challenge to gain more without increasing the number of years, or a {{iconify|Stewardship}} challenge to reduce the number of years (to a minimum of 1), this challenge is harder the larger the imbalance between obligations and support. Both challenges will reduce {{iconify|Prestige}} by 75 if they fail.

After negotiating the contract details the contractor will offer a timeline of 4 years to start a war for the claimed title. Passing a {{iconify|Martial}} challenge will increase the timeline to 8 years. Contractor also will get a favor weak hook {{icon|weak hook}} on the adventurer. If accepted, the contract does not show up in the Decisions & Contracts screen, there is no way to check for the deadline. You will get slightly less troops than agreed upon as each unit of heavy cavalry counts as two.

If the timeline passes and was isn't declared, if the camp purpose is changed, or the character becomes landed with a different title, it will eventually<!-- looking at the scripts, for the landing and camp purpose change it needs to run down the clock then it checks for failure, there is an event to try to get more time if you do not change the camp purpose nor get landed. Adding this information felt like it would make the already long part too long and complex--> end the contract, remove a Level of Fame and start a rivalry with the contractor. Troops and gold will remain.

== Becoming landed ==
Adventurers who becomes landed will gain the {{icon|adventurer}} Former Adventurer trait, all followers will become courtiers and gain the {{iconify|Follower}} trait, and their camp will be demolished with partial refunds for the cost of buildings. There are four ways in which an adventurer can become landed:
* They can inherit titles unless they have the {{iconify|Gallivanter}} trait.
* They can take over a realm via the Seize Realm scheme.
* They can conquer a realm via the Adventurer Invasion casus belli. They can also request rulers to provide them with soldiers and/or join the war against a {{iconify|King}} or {{iconify|Emperor}} but if successful the adventurer will become a vassal of the sponsor and it blocks titles equal or higher than the sponsor's primary title. Only one ruler can support an adventurer at at time.
* They can purchase land.
* If the {{iconify|Khans of the Steppe}} DLC is active, they can take the ''Adopt the [[Nomad]]ic Ways'' decision.

When an adventurer becomes landed they receive the Ennobled Adventurer negative modifier which gives the following penalties depending on how different his new realm is.

=== Purchasing land ===
Wealthy adventurers can purchase {{iconify|County}} or {{iconify|Duchy}} titles from Feudal, Clan or Tribal rulers that have one to spare and are at peace, and rulers can offer adventurers in their realm titles they hold. Adventurers with the {{iconify|Gallowsbait}} or {{iconify|Gallivanter}} trait cannot purchase titles. If the landed title is lower than the seller's primary title then the former adventurer will become their vassal. Purchasing land has the following cost:
{| class="mildtable plainlist"
! Title rank !! Buying as adventurer !! Offering as ruler
|-
! {{iconify|County}}
| 
* {{icon|gold}} 300 Gold
* {{iconify|Distinguished}} level of fame
| {{icon|legitimacy}} 100 Legitimacy
|-
! {{iconify|Duchy}}
| 
* {{icon|gold}} 600 Gold
* {{iconify|Illustrious}} level of fame
| {{icon|legitimacy}} 300 Legitimacy
|}

When purchasing land as an adventurer, the ruler's acceptance is based on their {{iconify|Opinion}} and is decreased by the number of titles purchased, the number of buildings and {{iconify|Development}} in the purchased counties and having a different faith or culture and increased by distance from their capital, the counties having a different faith or culture, being married into the ruler's family or the ruler being in debt. The adventurer can use a Hook or offer to pay double, offer a {{iconify|Weak Hook}} or have increased vassal obligations to improve the ruler's acceptance.

Administrative rulers will sell an estate instead of landed titles, which cost 200 {{iconify|Gold}} and 15 {{iconify|Opinion}} with everyone for 15 years.
