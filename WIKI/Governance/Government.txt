{{Version|1.18}}
{{Govnav}}
A government is the system that rules [[Character|characters]] and their titles. It determines the [[laws]] available to a character as well as any obligations (taxes and levies) a [[Subjects|vassal]] may have to their liege. Governments can only be changed via decisions. Governments are divided into three types:
* '''Landed governments''' require the character to own landed titles. If a player character loses all their landed titles, they must choose to play as another dynasty member or receive a game over but if the {{iconify|Roads to Power}} DLC is installed, they will have the option to choose between doing that or changing government to [[Adventurer]].
* '''Domicile governments''' give their house heads or potentially all rulers a domicile, which allows a player to play as them even if they do not own landed titles. If a ruler changes their government to a landed one, their domicile is sold for {{iconify|Gold}}, all title men-at-arms are removed, and if their government used {{iconify|Treasury}} or {{iconify|Herd}} they are converted to {{iconify|Gold}} as well. 
** {{iconify|Celestial}} Governments function based on the title Hegemony of China, and have access to Dynastic Cycle mechanics. See [[Celestial]] for more information.
** {{iconify|Meritocratic}} Governments are similar to Celestial. See [[Meritocratic]].
** {{iconify|Meritocratic Khanate}} Governments are similar to Meritocratic. See [[Meritocratic Khanate]].
** {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} Governments are special administrative government type for Japanese rulers. See [[Ritsuryō]] .
** {{iconify|Sōryō}} Governments are special feudal government type for Japanese rulers, but they have access to Domiciles. See [[Sōryō]].
* '''Non-dynastic governments''' do not use dynastic succession and as a result are not playable. When a character with a non-dynastic government dies another random character will inherit all titles.

== Landed governments ==
=== Tribal ===
Tribal governments have access to the Tribal Authority law, unlock Subjugate and Conquest casus belli, and can start a Co-Monarchy. All tribal rulers can raid unless their faith forbids it and gain 100 more {{iconify|Prestige}} when they win a battle. However, they cannot construct holdings or use innovations beyond the Tribal Era. Tribal rulers can only use the Confederate Partition succession law but unlock the Challenge the Ruler decision. Tribal rulers have access to an inferior [[Royal court|Royal Court]].

[[Development]] only affects the Supply Limit and does not passively grow in counties ruled by a tribal ruler. Tribal baronies only provide half of their supply limit to armies belonging to other governments.

Tribal governments have the following unique effects:
*Tribal rulers pay for [[men-at-arms]] using {{iconify|Prestige}} instead of {{iconify|Gold}}.
*Tribal rulers cannot [[Prisoner|imprison]] vassals or [[courtiers]] without passing level 2 Tribal Authority.
*Tribal vassals provide taxes and levies based on the Liege's [[Resources#Fame|Level of Fame]].
*{{green|−50%}} {{icon|Gold}} [[Titles|Title]] creation cost. 
*{{green|+0.2}} monthly {{iconify|Prestige}}.
*{{red|−20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with vassals that do not have {{iconify|Tribal}}, {{iconify|Wanua}} or {{iconify|Nomadic}} government

=== Feudal ===
Feudal governments can create new holdings and cadet branches, have access to the Crown Authority law, can apply Title Succession laws and can start a Co-Monarchy.

=== Clan ===
Clan governments can create new holdings and cadet branches and have access to the Crown Authority law. All powerful vassals will want to be in an Alliance with their liege and will gain {{red|-30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} of their liege if they are not. When clan rulers are at peace, they can appoint a Vizier.

If a clan ruler is a Dynasty Head, their realm will be named after their dynasty rather than the primary title.

==== Tax Jurisdictions ====
[[File:Tax Jurisdictions.png|thumb|350px|Tax Jurisdictions]]
Clan governments collect taxes and levies from vassals with the same government type by creating Tax Jurisdictions and assigning vassals to them. Tax Jurisdictions are accessible via a sidebar tab only available to Clan governments, or from the bottom of the Realm sidebar, on the Vassals tab. Every jurisdiction can handle up to 12 taxpayers, and each jurisdiction requires a {{iconify|Tax Collector}}. Count and Duke rulers can appoint 1 {{iconify|Tax Collector}} while King and Emperor rulers can appoint 2. Cultures with the Enlightened Magnates or Legalistic tradition can each appoint an additional one, as can dynasties with the first [[File:Khvarenah legacy track.png|24px]] Brilliance legacy. A Vizier, depending on its Stewardship score, can grant from 1 additional {{iconify|Tax Collector}} to 5. Two Innovations, Magistrates and Court Officials, also each grant an additional one. First perk from Avaricious stewardship lifestyle tree - Golden obligation also grants one 1 {{iconify|Tax Collector}}. Only unlanded courtiers can be appointed as {{iconify|Tax Collector}}. How much taxes and levies a Tax Jurisdiction provides depends on the {{iconify|Tax Collector}}'s aptitude, which is the following: 
*{{green|+1}} per {{iconify|Diplomacy}} (max 50)
*{{green|+1}} per {{iconify|Martial}} (max 50)
*{{green|+1}} per {{iconify|Stewardship}} (max 50)
*{{green|+1}} per {{iconify|Intrigue}} (max 50)
*{{green|+2}} per {{iconify|Learning}} (max 50)
*{{green|+5}} per 20 {{iconify|Opinion}}
*{{green|+10}} if {{iconify|Just}}
*{{green|+10}} if {{iconify|Administrator}}
*{{green|+10}} if {{iconify|Avaricious}}
*{{green|+10}} if {{iconify|Diplomat}}
*{{green|+15}} if culture has the Enlightened Magnates tradition
*{{green|+20}} if culture has the Family Business tradition
*{{red|-10}} if vassal

Each Tax Jurisdiction has a Tax Decree, which determines what all vassals assigned to the jurisdiction pay. Each Tax Decree can only be changed once every 5 years and the menu will show current taxes and levies and taxes and levies should the Tax Decree be changed. Existing vassals will be removed as taxpayers if the new Tax Decree does not allow them.

==== House unity ====
[[File:Impassive house unity.png|thumb|350px|Impassive house unity]]
If a House Head has Clan government, then its house will have an additional mechanic called House Unity, representing how well members of a house tend to get along with each other. It will be displayed for all house members but only those who have Clan government will be affected by its effects. House Unity is increased by taking Unifying Actions towards them and decreased by taking Divisive Actions towards them. House Heads also gain access to the ''Extol Virtuousness'' and ''Accuse of Decadence'' interactions with other house members as well as the ''Steer House Unity'' decision.

=== Mandala ===
{{expansion|auh}}
Mandala governments can create new holdings and cadet branches and ask rulers to become tributaries willingly, and unlock the Capital Temple Complex and Capital Temple Complex Upgrade great projects. They also have access to the Decree law but the only succession available is Mandala Succession. They cannot build or upgrade [[File:Holding church.png|24px]] Temple holdings but can build and upgrade [[File:Holding temple citadel.png|24px]] Temple Citadel holdings instead. Dynasty Heads with Mandala government also unlock the [[File:Southeast asia legacy track.png|24px]] Divine Aspirations legacy track.

Rulers with Mandala government have 8 levels of {{iconify|Legitimacy}} and are affected the same way regardless of their primary title rank. They also inherit the Level of Devotion of their predecessor and can reach the final three Levels of Devotion if their predecessor had the highest Level of Devotion they could reach and died of natural causes or religion and they also unlock the Raze Capital Temple Complex casus belli against each other. However their {{iconify|Domain}} is limited to 4.

Every ruler with Mandala government has a Mandala Radiance value, which depends on their Level of Devotion, level of aspect, perks, whether they are independent or not, and number of Capital Temple Complex buildings and decreases with distance from the capital. Mandala Radiance affects the acceptance of other rulers to become tributaries. If the Capital Temple Complex building in the realm capital is ruined, Mandala Radiance will be set to 0.

Creating titles with Mandala government requires a sufficient {{iconify|Piety}} and Level of Devotion: 500 and Faithful for {{iconify|Duchy}}, 2500 and Devoted Servant for {{iconify|Kingdom}}, 5000 and Religious Icon for {{iconify|Empire}}.

Only rulers with a faith that has the {{iconify|Polytheist}} main doctrine can have Mandala government. If they convert to a faith with the {{iconify|Monotheist}} main doctrine, their government is changed to Feudal. They must also belong to a culture with one of the following cultural heritages:

Austronesian, Tai, Mon Khmer, Viet, Indo Aryan or Burman.

Every house head with Mandala government can choose a Mandala Aspect, which can be upgraded every 5 years up to 4 times once the aspect's upgrade requirements are met. The aspect can be changed at the cost of 500 {{iconify|Piety}} but this will reset it back to level 1. If the aspect is upgraded to its maximum level, upon succession the heir will receive the option to automatically pass the Mandala Succession trial challenge from the current aspect.
* Level 2 aspects cost 250 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 1000 {{iconify|Piety}} and requires the {{iconify|Pilgrim}} trait to have at least 25 experience
* Level 3 aspects cost 500 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 2500 {{iconify|Piety}} and requires the {{iconify|Pilgrim}} trait to have at least 50 experience
* Level 4 aspects cost 1000 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 5000 {{iconify|Piety}} and requires the {{iconify|Pilgrim}} trait to have at least 75 experience
* Level 5 aspects cost 2000 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 10000 {{iconify|Piety}} and requires the {{iconify|Pilgrim}} trait to have maximum experience

=== Wanua ===
{{expansion|auh}}
Wanua governments have access to the Tribal Authority law, unlock Subjugate and Conquest casus belli, and can start a Co-Monarchy. Wanua rulers can sail in major rivers, can raid unless their faith forbids it, and gain 100 more {{iconify|Prestige}} when they win a battle. However they cannot construct holdings or use innovations beyond the Tribal Era, can only use the Confederate Partition succession law, and have a starting maximum domain limit of 2. Wanua rulers have access to an inferior [[Royal court|Royal Court]]. Dynasty Heads with Wanua government also unlock the [[File:Southeast asia legacy track.png|24px]] Divine Aspirations legacy track.

Wanua rulers gain access to the {{iconify|Barter Goods}} resource, which is used to pay for men-at-arms maintenance. They also unlock the ability to raise their armies as Barterers, which can travel to other rulers' countries to convert {{iconify|Barter Goods}} into {{iconify|Gold}} at a 2:1 ratio. Hovering over a county while a Barterer army is selected will display how much {{iconify|Gold}} will be obtained and its cost in {{iconify|Barter Goods}} and hovering over an army that is bartering will display how long will it take for the conversion to be finished. How much will be bartered depends on the size of the army. Barterer armies can be attacked by Raiding armies and if they are defeated the Raiding army will take their Loot. Bartering will give the county the [[File:Modifier goods positive.png|24px]] Recently Bartered modifier for 5 years, which prevents further bartering and gives the following bonuses:
* {{icon|gold}} {{green|+10%}} Holding Taxes
* {{icon|time}} {{green|-10%}} Building Construction Time
* {{icon|development}} {{green|+0.3}} Monthly Development
* {{icon|yes}} Cannot be raided

[[Development]] only affects the Supply Limit and does not passively grow in counties ruled by a wanua ruler. Wanua baronies only provide half of their supply limit to armies belonging to other governments.

Wanua governments have the following unique effects:
*Wanua rulers cannot [[Prisoner|imprison]] vassals or [[courtiers]] without passing level 2 Tribal Authority.
*Wanua vassals provide taxes and levies based on the Liege's [[Resources#Fame|Level of Fame]].
*{{green|−50%}} {{icon|Gold}} [[Titles|Title]] creation cost. 
*{{green|+0.2}} monthly {{iconify|Prestige}}.

If the DLC is not installed, all Wanua rulers will use Tribal government.

== Non-dynastic governments ==
If a player selects a [[File:Herder government.png|24px]] Herder character to play, said character will automatically become {{iconify|Nomadic}} when the game starts.

Realm Priests receive vassal income at a rate of 25% from Realm Priests belonging to their liege's direct vassals. They also provide up to 50% of their income from directly-controlled churches and their vassal priests to their feudal liege, scaled based on opinion.
