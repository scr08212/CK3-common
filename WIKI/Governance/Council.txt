[[File:Council screen.png|300px|thumb|right|A council]]
The '''council''' is a group of specialized vassals or courtier that help a landed character rule their realm. If a councilor is also a commander, it cannot lead troops while assigned to a task.

Each councilor can be assigned to one of a number of tasks. Current progress towards a councilor task is lost if the task is changed, except for ''Integrate Title'' and ''Increase Development/Control in County''. Progress is not lost if the councilor dies. While a councilor is performing a task, one event related to it can trigger each year, although they are prohibited from occurring in the first month of assignment. Positive events can take place if the councilor's skill is above '''8''' and negative events can take place if the councilor's skill is below '''15'''. Each task's effect scales linearly with the councilor's skill. In addition, all tasks are performed 20% more efficiently if the councilor is a {{iconify|Friend}} of the liege, 30% more efficiently if the councilor is a {{iconify|Best Friend}} of the liege, 20% less efficiently if the councilor is a {{iconify|Rival}} of the liege, and 30% less efficiently if the councilor is a [[File:Nemesis.png|24px]] Nemesis of the liege.

Characters cannot be appointed Councilors if they have the {{iconify|Incapable}} trait.

== Spymaster ==
The Spymaster is a position available to all rulers. It uses {{iconify|Intrigue}} as primary skill and its purpose is to help the ruler's schemes and protect them against hostile schemes. If the liege has {{iconify|Celestial}} government the council position will be renamed to Imperial Censor and will receive the {{icon|empire}} The Censorate title. The council position has three possible tasks:

== Confidant ==
The Confidant is a position available to all rulers who do not have both {{iconify|Celestial}} government and {{iconify|Hegemony}} title rank and occupied in the following order:
# The vizier, if that character has any.
# The primary spouse, if unlanded or direct vassal.

The confidant can perform the following tasks. There are no negative effects if they have low skill.

=== Religious affairs councilor ===
There are two possible religious affair councilors, depending on the Clerical Tradition doctrine of the ruler's faith. Both of them use {{iconify|Learning}} as their primary skill. Who appoints them and for how long depends on the faith's Clerical Appointment doctrine. A character with the {{iconify|Excommunicated}} trait cannot be appointed to this conucil position if faith has the Communion tenet unless the liege has the same trait.
* [[File:Religious councillor job.png|24px]] Court Chaplain is the position available if the faith has the {{iconify|Lay Clergy}} doctrine and has no special mechanics.
* [[File:Bishop job.png|24px]] Realm Priest is the position available if the faith has the {{iconify|Theocratic}} doctrine. The court positions leases all Temple holdings in the liege's domain and receive a portion of the Taxes and Levies of every vassal's Realm Priest of the same faith. Realm Priests provide their liege with taxes and levies equal to their Opinion, ranging from {{red|0}} to {{green|50}}. They provide all their Taxes and Levies regardless of Opinion if their liege has a Strong Hook on them.

The council position has three possible tasks:

== Minister council ==
{{expansion|auh}}
Rulers who have {{iconify|Celestial}} government and a {{iconify|Hegemony}} primary title have 8 additional council positions. Councilors gain a titular {{iconify|Empire}} title, can be given the [[File:Favored minister court position.png|24px]] Favored Minister council position and they themselves unlock the [[File:Minister bureaucrat court position.png|24px]] Development Aide court position but they cannot have landed titles and will trigger a succession if they own any when they're appointed. They also receive a salary that is decided in the realm budget allocation. One of the councilors will be the diarch, decided by the Grand Secretariat Control law. When a councilor dies the character in the realm with the highest Merit Rank will replace it. The liege can manually replace councilors but doing so will add {{yellow|+10}} Dynastic Cycle Progress towards Tension.

Rulers can use the following additional interactions with councilors:
* '''Request Mentorship''' requires choosing a character at the court. The councilor will gain {{green|+30}} {{iconify|Merit}} and the selected character will become the councilor's Disciple. The councilor can be asked to give the selected character {{iconify|Merit}}, a commander trait the councilor has, or the {{iconify|Confucian Education}} trait if the councilor has it.
* '''Requisition Treasury''' asks to take half of the councilor's {{iconify|Treasury}}, up to a maximum of 400 per councilor title rank. It costs 30 {{iconify|Influence}} and the cost is increased by 10 for each Merit Rank the councilor has. The councilor can refuse but refusing costs 60 {{iconify|Influence}} and the cost is increased by 30 for each level of {{iconify|Merit}} that the councilor has lower than the liege.
* '''Request Commander''' is only available with the Minister of War councilor and allows selecting a courtier of the councilor to add to the hegemon's court. The interaction costs 55 {{iconify|Treasury}} and the selected courtier must be adult, allowed to be a commander, and cannot be a close family member of the councilor.
