Prisoners are characters who are held at someone's court unwillingly.  A character can obtain prisoners via the [[Abduction scheme]], occupying a character's realm capital while at war or following battles if the enemy commander has low {{iconify|Prowess}}. A ruler can attempt to imprison any character within their realm but this will incur tyranny, particularly if the prisoner is Noble, unless they are guilty of a Crime. An imprisoned character can be released, ransomed, tortured or executed.

If a prisoner is the third or closer in line to a ruler's primary title it will provide War Score in war against the said ruler but will be released at the end of any such war.

== Prisoner value ==
A prisoner's title rank affects how valuable they are if released, ransomed or punished.

== Imprisonment effects ==
Characters will be imprisoned in either the dungeon or under house arrest and can be freely moved between the two. By default prisoners are held in the dungeon if Lowborn and house arrest if Noble. While imprisoned they suffer the following penalties:
{| class="mildtable"
! 
! House arrest

! {{iconify|Diplomacy}}
| {{red|-5}} || {{red|-5}}
|-

|-
! {{icon|crime}} Escape chance
| '''Normal''' || {{red|Reduced}}
|}

A prisoner will gain {{iconify|Stress}} while in prison and will eventually die if they have too much stress.

== Negotiate release ==
A ruler can offer to release a prisoner in exchange for one or more of the following:
{| class="mildtable"
! Condition
! Acceptance
! Opinion for 10 years
! Requirements
|-
| Gain Weak Hook
| {{red|-80}}
| {{red|-20}}
| 
|-
| Demand conversion
| {{red|-20}}
| {{red|-10}}
| Different faith<br>Prisoner is not an independent ruler<br>Prisoner is not a head of faith
|-
| Banish
| {{red|-50}}
| {{red|-20}}
| Prisoner is not an independent ruler<br>Prisoner is not an adventurer
|-
| Recruit
| {{red|-10}}
| {{red|-15}}
| Prisoner is not a ruler<br>Prisoner is not an adventurer<br>Prisoner is not a courtier
|-
| Renounce claims
| {{red|-25}}
| {{red|-30}}
| Prisoner has claims on one of the owned titles
|-
| Take the vows
| {{red|-30}}
| {{red|-10}}
| Same faith<br>Faith has the Monasticism tenet<br>Prisoner is a family member<br>Prisoner is a courtier
|}
Releasing a prisoner with no demands costs {{red|10}} {{iconify|Dread}} and gives {{green|20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 10 years with the prisoner. Releasing a character with no demands may give {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if their title rank is high enough.

== Ransom ==
A ruler can ransom imprisoned characters, exchanging {{iconify|gold}} or a {{iconify|weak hook}} for the prisoner's freedom. The ''Ransom'' interaction is used on the prisoner, not the recipient. The character who is sent the ransom is decided in the following order:
# The prisoner themselves if they are landed
# Their direct liege if prisoner is a courtier
# The prisoner themselves, if they are unlanded
Prisoners and their direct liege may also offer to pay ransom to the jailer, with an additional option of using a hook on the jailer. Vassals and courtiers who have their ransom paid for by their liege gain {{green|+5}} {{iconify|opinion}} for 1 year.

When paying with {{iconify|gold}}, the ransom cost of a given prisoner depends on the ransom recipient's primary title rank as well as the prisoner's relation with the recipient. If a spouse is also the primary heir and/or close family, only the spouse price applies. If the ransom recipient is unable to afford the full price of the ransom, the price is reduced to as much gold as they have left. If the jailor has the ''[[Golden Obligations]]'' perk, all ransom costs are increased to approximately 6 times the jailor's tax income (minimum of 50, maximum of 300 gold). Characters who are unlanded and liegeless cost 100 gold to ransom if the jailer has the ''Golden Obligations'' perk (can be increased further) or if the character at least 100 gold to spare.

== Punishment ==
Punishing a character will may grant {{iconify|Dread}} depending on punishment and the prisoner's title rank

=== Execution ===
Executing an imprisoned character gives {{red|-20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the victim's dynasty, {{red|-25}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the victim's liege, {{red|-30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the victim's friends and lovers, {{red|-50}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the victim's family and spouses, and {{red|+2}} Tyranny unless the prisoner is guilty of a very severe crime or follows a faith considered Hostile or Evil. There are 3 execution methods:
{| class="mildtable plainlist"
! Execution method
! {{iconify|Piety}}
! Requirements
|-
| '''Behead'''
| 
* {{red|-25}} if the character is lowborn
* {{red|-100}} if the character is noble
| 
* {{icon|yes}} Same faith
* {{icon|no}} Faith has the Gruesome Festivals tenet
|-
| '''Burn at Stake'''
| {{green|+25}} if the faith has the Fundamentalist doctrine
| 
* {{icon|no}} Same faith
* {{icon|no}} Faith has the Gruesome Festivals tenet
|-
| '''Sacrifice'''
| 
* {{green|+50}} if the prisoner has the same faith
* {{green|+250}} if the prisoner has a different faith
| {{icon|yes}} Faith has the Gruesome Festivals tenet
|}
The execution can be enhanced with the following options, which will add some additional effects to it:
* Characters with the {{iconify|Cannibal}} trait or whose faith has the Ritual Cannibalism tenet can choose to devour the prisoner, which grants {{green|-35}} {{iconify|Stress}} at the cost of a 20% chance to gain the {{iconify|Ill}} trait and will give the character the {{iconify|Cannibal}} trait if they don't already have it.
* Rulers who employ an [[File:Executioner court position.png|24px]] Executioner can choose to make the execution public, which grants {{green|+15}} Popular Opinion for 5 years in the realm capital and increase Control in all domain counties by {{green|+3}} for each Aptitude level.
* Adventurers who have the Long Pig Intrigue lifestyle perk can choose to turn the prisoner into a random amount of {{iconify|Provisions}}.

If the character has a royal court and the {{iconify|Arbitrary}}, {{iconify|Deceitful}}, {{iconify|Callous}}, {{iconify|Sadistic}} or {{iconify|Vengeful}} trait, executing a rival has a 25% chance to give the option to turn their skull into a pedestal item artifact. The offer is guaranteed if the prisoner was a nemesis. If the ruler does not have an [[File:Executioner court position.png|24px]] Executioner it will lose {{red|-30}} {{iconify|Opinion}} with the Personal Physician or Antiquarian.

=== Torture ===
Torturing a character will give the following:
* The torturer character loses {{red|−100}} {{iconify|piety}} if its faith forbids it.
* The torturer character loses {{green|−10}} {{iconify|stress}} if they have the {{iconify|Sadistic}} trait
* The torturer character gains {{red|+10}} {{iconify|stress}} if they have the {{iconify|Trusting}} trait
* The torturer character gains {{red|+100}} {{iconify|Stress}} if they have the {{iconify|Compassionate}} trait
* The tortured character loses {{red|−75}} {{iconify|opinion}} for 50 years towards the torturing character
* The tortured character gains the Recently Tortured modifier for 5 years giving {{icon|health penalty}} {{red|−0.75}} Health
* If the tortured character has or knows a secret it will have the option to reveal it to avoid torture

=== Tradition punishments ===
The following punishments are only available for adult characters if their culture has certain traditions:
* '''Castration''' is available to cultures with the Amharic Highlanders, Court Eunuchs, Byzantine Traditions or Palace Politics traditions. If the prisoner has below 12 years he will gain the {{iconify|Beardless Eunuch}} trait, otherwise it will gain the {{iconify|Eunuch}} trait. The castrated character has a 66% chance to gain a major penalty to {{iconify|Health}} and {{iconify|Stress}} for 5 years unless the character employs a {{icon|court physician}} Personal Physician, in which case the chance ranges from 50% to 15% depending on Aptitude. Castrating gives {{red|-50}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 50 years with the prisoner and {{red|-20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 20 years with their close family and spouses.
* '''Blinding''' is available to cultures with the Byzantine Traditions, Merciful Blindings or Palace Politics tradition. The prisoner gains the {{iconify|Blind}} trait. Blinding gives {{red|-50}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 50 years with the prisoner and {{red|-20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 20 years with their close family and spouses.
* '''Maiming''' is available only to characters in a Duumvirate and will end the power sharing. Can choose to give the prisoner the {{iconify|Blind}}, {{iconify|Disfigured}}, {{iconify|One-Legged}} or {{iconify|Maimed}}. Males can also be castrated. If the co-emperor does it, they take all of the emperor's titles except the family nobly family one.

=== Sun trial ===
Sun trial is a punishment available to faits with the Sun Worship tenet and only towards prisoners who are guilty of a crime. The characters will gain 100 {{icon|piety pagan}} Piety. The prisoner will either die or survive, and if they survive and have the same faith they will gain {{green|+3}} Monthly Piety and {{green|+15}} Same Faith Opinion for 15 years. The chance to survive depends on the terrain of the realm capital and the {{iconify|Health}} of the prisoner.

Crimes of courtiers and vassals may be pardoned, preventing just imprisonment in exchange for an {{iconify|opinion}} bonus. The following actions are crimes:
