Situations are major historical incidents that involve more than one ruler and are happening over a period of time. Situations go through multiple phases, which determine how each ruler is affected by them.

== Natural disasters ==
Natural disasters cannot happen in the first 10 years of a game. Afterwards, one of each natural disaster will take place every year. Selecting a disaster will display all affected counties with a flashing red border. Natural disasters are 2 times less likely to take place in the de jure capital of a {{iconify|Duchy}}, and 4 times less likely if it's also the de jure capital of a {{iconify|Kingdom}}. They are also 10 times less likely to take place in a region that already had a natural disaster.

Natural disaster situations affect the owners of counties where the disaster takes place, as well as any liege they have.

Every natural disaster has one of three levels of severity.

Every natural disaster situation has 3 phases.
# '''Warning''' phases last 40 days; halfway through, every affected ruler will receive the option to gain 10 {{iconify|Stress}} and enter a regency while the situation lasts so that recovery contributions will cost 10% less. If the ruler is already in a regency the ruler will not gain {{iconify|Stress}}.
# '''Impact''' phases last 30 days. Every affected ruler will lose 50 {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if not Hegemon of China and 100 [[File:Mandate legitimacy.png|24px]] Legitimacy if Hegemon of China and every location will lose {{iconify|Control}}, will no longer increase in {{iconify|Development}}, and will receive a modifier based on the situation's severity for 25 years. Every 7 days characters will die, every army located in the situation region has a 25-75% chance to be damaged and lose supplies (depending on its size), and the rulers affected will receive a random negative event. The map terrain will visibly change, and remain as altered until the situation ends.
# '''Recovery''' phases last for 15 years and give every affected ruler {{red|-0.25}} {{icon|legitimacy}} Monthly Legitimacy. Affected rulers can pay various contributions to receive bonuses. The cost of each contribution depends on the number of counties affected, the severity of the disaster, the ruler's {{icon|gold}} Tax income and the innovations from their culture. If all mandatory contributions have been paid, the situation will end after another two months, and all penalties from the disaster will be removed. If the disaster affects multiple independent realms, each realm must pay the contributions separately to end the disaster within their own realm.

If a human player would be picked for death during a situation, both the player's character and a close family member, always the primary heir if there is one, will be at risk and the player will receive the following choices:
* Try to survive together through a twice as difficult {{iconify|Prowess}} challenge. Both characters will be wounded, and if the challenge is failed one of the characters will die.
* Try to survive separately through a {{iconify|Prowess}} challenge. Any character who fails the challenge will die.
* Sacrifice yourself to save the family member. The player character will die, the family member will escape unharmed, and the dynasty will gain 250 {{iconify|Renown}}.
* Sacrifice the family member to survive. The family member will die and the player character will escape unharmed; the player character will lose 350 {{iconify|Prestige}} and 250 {{iconify|Piety}}, and gain the {{iconify|Craven}} trait.

=== Earthquake ===
Earthquakes affect an epicenter county and every adjacent county. An earthquake can take place anywhere in the world but is influenced by the following:
* Twice more likely if located in Asia Minor, China, Middle East, North-Eastern Africa, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines or Southern Europe
* Twice more likely if the county has at least one barony with {{iconify|Mountains}} or {{iconify|Desert Mountains}} terrain

Earthquakes have the following levels of severity:

=== Flood ===
Floods can only take place in counties adjacent to a major river. The major river can be any in the world but it is twice more likely to cause a flood if any adjacent barony has {{iconify|Farmlands}} or {{iconify|Plains}} terrain.

Floods have the following levels of severity. They will always have a severity of 2 or 3 if the flooding river is Nile or Yellow River.

If all mandatory contributions are paid every county affected by the disaster will gain the [[File:Modifier county development positive.png|24px]] Good Fertility modifier for 10 years, which gives the following bonuses:
* {{icon|supply}} {{green|+25%}} Supply Limit
* {{icon|development}} {{green|+15%}} Development Growth
* {{icon|kos}} {{green|+25%}} County Fertility Growth

== Struggles ==
A struggle goes through multiple phases that change 3 months after sufficient Catalysts, actions that push the struggle towards the next phase, take place. All characters will be considered Involved, Interloper, or Uninvolved in a struggle, which determines how much they can influence it and how much they can be influenced by it.

Ending a struggle will give a {{iconify|Heroic legend}} seed.

=== Iberian Struggle ===
{{expansion|foi}}
The Iberian Struggle is present in all start dates.

A faith or culture will become involved in the Iberian Struggle if 80% of the counties that follow it are present in the region of Iberia. In addition the following faiths and cultures will always be involved:
* Faiths: {{iconify|Mozarabism}}, {{iconify|Catholicism}}, {{iconify|Muwalladism}}, {{iconify|Ash'arism}}
* Cultures: Andalusian, Aragonese, Asturleonese, Basque, Castilian, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Bedouin, Maghrebi, Mashriqi, Baranis, Sephardi

=== Iranian Intermezzo ===
{{expansion|lop}}
The Iranian Intermezzo is present only in 867. While the situation is present [[File:Nation fracturing faction.png|24px]] Dissolution factions cannot form for the Abbasid Empire.

A faith or culture will become involved in the Iranian Intermezzo if 50% of the counties that follow it are present in the region of Persia. In addition the following faiths and cultures will always be involved:
* Faiths: {{iconify|Ash'arism}}, {{iconify|Maturidism}}, {{iconify|Mu'tazilism}}, {{iconify|Isma'ilism}}, {{iconify|Zayidism}}, {{iconify|Imamism}}, {{iconify|Azraqism}}, {{iconify|Alevism}}, {{iconify|Mazdayasna}}, {{iconify|Khurmazdism}}, {{iconify|Khurramism}}, {{iconify|Afridunism}}, {{iconify|Mahayana}}, {{iconify|Nestorianism}}
* Cultures: Afghan, Baloch, Daylamite, Khwarezmian, Kurdish, Persian, Sogdian, Tajik, Bedouin, Mashriqi, Yemeni, Brahui

All characters that begin Involved or Interloper in the Iranian Intermezzo will have either the {{iconify|Detractor of the Caliphate}} or {{iconify|Supporter of Caliphal Authority}} trait, which determines their stance. The trait and stance can be switched via a decision but this can only be done every 20 years unless the current Sunni Caliph dies. Newly arrived rulers who become Involved or Interloper will also unlock a decision to choose a side. If a ruler with the {{iconify|Supporter of Caliphal Authority}} trait kills the Sunni Caliph and is not part of the same dynasty they will automatically change sides and cannot switch back. If a ruler with the {{iconify|Detractor of the Caliphate}} inherits the Sunni Caliphate title they will automatically change sides. During the Iranian Intermezzo the Sunni Caliphate title cannot be destroyed.

==== Phases ====
The Iranian Intermezzo starts in the [[File:Struggle persia phase unrest.png|24px]] Unrest phase and will alternate between it and the [[File:Struggle persia phase stabilisation.png|24px]] Stabilization phase until ended.

== Dynastic Cycle ==
{{expansion|auh}}
The Dynastic Cycle is present in all start dates. A character will become an interloper if it either owns de jure territory of Hegemony of China or they are located inside a barony that's both de jure part of Hegemony of China's and currently owned by them. They will become involved if they are either part of Hegemony of China or if they are a tributary who has Palace Access in their contract.
 
Phases of the Dynastic Cycle are called eras. In 1066 it starts in the Advancement era, in 867 and 1178 it starts in the Tension era, and in 867 it also starts with 40% progress towards the Division era. The situation will alternate between Tension and either Advancement or Expansion. Which era will be picked depends on the Favored Era, which can be selected by the Hegemon every 20 years at the cost of 250 {{iconify|Influence}}. If the the Hegemony of China title is taken by a character who does not have {{iconify|Celestial}} government, whose culture does not have Han heritage, who is not part of the same dynasty as the previous owner, the era will change to Conquest.

Every 10 years the hegemon and members of a political movement can add 50 Catalyst Progress towards or away from Advancement, Expansion, or Division. This costs 250 {{iconify|Influence}} and 200 [[File:Group power.png|24px]] Power for their movement (Pro-Dynasty if the hegemon does it).

=== Division ===
The Division phase can be reached either through Catalysts during the Tension or Conquest phase or if the hegemon owns less than 30% of China's de jure territory or reaches the [[File:Mandate legitimacy 0.png|24px]] Illegitimate Ruler legitimacy level. When the Division phase is reached the {{iconify|Hegemony}} of China title is destroyed, the former hegemon suffers an immediate succession, and all its subjects become independent. Every {{iconify|Kingdom}} title that is part of it is also destroyed if its holder has less than 100 {{iconify|Movement Power}} and every {{iconify|Empire}} title that is part of it is also destroyed if its holder has less than 350 {{iconify|Movement Power}}. The Silk Road situation will enter the Hardship phase in every region and the Attend Children's Examination decision will become unavailable.

As a result of the changes, every previously involved ruler will become an interloper. All interlopers will receive {{red|-20%}} {{icon|gold}} Taxes and {{green|+100%}} {{iconify|Legitimacy}} from completing great projects; will gain {{iconify|Legitimacy}} if they appoint characters with Merit Rank 1-4 as governors, councilors and court positions; and will unlock the Consolidate Land Under Heaven casus belli. The only way for the Division phase to end is by claiming the Mandate of Heaven, which is available to all independent rulers who control more than half of the de jure counties of {{iconify|Hegemony}} of China. A ruler who claims the Mandate of Heaven immediately receives the following rewards:
* {{iconify|Hegemony}} of China title
* {{icon|treasury}} 1000 Treasury
* {{icon|influence}} 1000 Influence
* {{icon|renown}} 2500 Renown
* {{icon|control}} 25 Control in every county de jure part of Hegemony of China
* [[File:Mandate legitimacy.png|24px]] Maximum Legitimacy
* {{icon|vassal}} Tributaries with the capital in the de jure territory of Hegemony of China become vassals
* {{icon|celestial}} Change government to Celestial if not already
* {{icon|celestial}} Vassals that don't have Republic or Theocracy government change government to Celestial and gain Merit scaled by their age and skills
* {{icon|vassal}} Independent rulers with the capital in the de jure territory of Hegemony of China that have Celestial government, the same heritage or the same dynasty are vassalized
* [[File:Modifier dragon seal positive.png|24px]] Son of Heaven permanent modifier
* Choice to change the situation phase to either Advancement or Expansion
* Every courtier with at least 3000 Merit creates a noble family if not part of one
* Councilors are replaced if characters with higher Merit Rank are available

=== Political movements ===
In the Dynastic Cycle situation all subjects of China are divided among four sides, called Political Movements. Political Movements give various effects depending on the current era. A subject can change their Political Movement every 5 years at the cost of 250 {{iconify|Influence}}. The hegemon can favor a movement every 20 years at the cost of 250 {{iconify|Influence}} and 25 Progress towards [[File:Dynastic cycle phase chaos.png|24px]] Division.

Every subject of China involved in the Dynastic Cycle has a Personal Movement Power, which is increased by the following:
* Age
* Title rank
* Merit rank
* Level of devotion
* Level of influence
* Men-at-arms
* Governor trait experience
* Estate upgrades
* Power of disciples
* Being a councilor
* Being a diarch
Every Political Movement has a Movement Power, which is the sum of Personal Movement Power of all members. Reaching 350 Movement Power unlocks for every member the [[File:Domicile astrologer yurt.png|24px]] Yamen Grievance Drum estate upgrade and reaching 800 Movement Power unlocks for every member Dismiss Hook and Request Permission to Raid interactions and the Raid Estate scheme.

Every Political Movement has a leader, who unlocks the Make Movement Petition decision. When the leader dies the character with most Personal Movement Power becomes the new leader but they will be replaced if they are defeated in a [[File:Activity debate.png|24px]] Debate activity.

== The Silk Road ==
{{expansion|auh}}
The Silk Road situation affects all rulers with their capital in one of the situation regions. There are 6 situation regions, connected in the following order: Occident < Transcaspia and India < Central Asia and Tibet < China. Every region has an innovation assigned and every 12 years a random innovation discovered by the Han culture will be assigned to the China situation and all existing innovations will move westwards. These innovations can be researched normally by cultures with Chinese heritage or the Sinophilic tradition as well as if a ruler of that culture controls the region's hub while the innovation is present in the region. Other rulers can attempt to unlock these innovations by taking the Visit a Silk Road Market decision and passing the skill challenge.

How each ruler is affected depends on the phase in their region and their participant group.
