{{Version|1.18}}
{{icon|alliance}} An '''Alliance''' is an agreement between two characters that they can call upon or join each other's [[warfare|wars]] via a character interaction and cannot revoke titles if one is a vassal unless guilty of a crime. Declaring war on an ally will add {{red|-25}} Popular Opinion for 3 years. If the requirements to create an alliance are no longer met it will be ended automatically but ongoing wars are not affected. Alliances can only be created between characters who are {{iconify|Count}}s or above, whether landed or landless.

Two {{icon|hegemony}} Hegemons can't ally with each other.

== Creating an alliance ==
Alliances are created automatically between two characters who are married. They are also created automatically when two close family members of the two rulers are married or betrothed to each other. It is possible to see whether the marriage proposal will result in an alliance on the marriage proposal screen. Rulers who are at peace and not imprisoned may negotiate an alliance if they meet one of the following conditions:
* The characters are close or extended family members of each other or the other's spouse. This is not possible between cousins.
* The proposer has the Defensive Negotiations perk from the {{iconify|Diplomacy lifestyle}}. This is not possible between vassals and their liege.
In multiplayer, if a player has rejected an offer of alliance the other player cannot send another one with the same character.

The acceptance of an alliance is determined by the following:
* Between {{red|-1000}} and {{green|+100}} depending on the military strength difference between the two characters
* Between {{red|-120}} and {{green|+120}} depending on the title rank difference between the two characters
* Between {{red|-100}} and {{green|+25}} depending on the opinion of the recipient
* Between {{red|-100}} and {{green|+50}} depending on legitimacy
* {{green|+25}} if the characters are friends
* {{green|+25}} if the characters are lovers
* {{green|+20}} if one of the characters is the other's liege
* {{green|+20}} if the characters are close family members
* {{green|+10}} if the characters are part of the same house
* {{green|+10}} if the characters are extended family members
* {{green|+10}} if one of the characters is the other's primary heir
* {{red|-100}} if the characters were at war with each other within the last 12 years
* {{red|-100}} if the characters are rivals
* {{red|-300}} if the characters are nemeses

A proposed Alliance can be accepted by using a [[Hook]], either Weak or Strong.

== Joining wars ==
When a character is at war, each one of their allies will have the option to join the war via the ''Offer to Join War'' character interaction, which the targeted character will always accept. Alternatively, a character who is at war will have the option to ask their allies to join a war via the ''Call to War'' character interaction. The acceptance is determined by the character's {{iconify|Opinion}}, modified by the following:
{| class="mildtable"
! Source
! Acceptance
|-
| Heir
| {{green|always}}
|-
| Spouse
| {{green|always}}
|-
| Defensive War
| {{green|+50}}
|-
| Defensive War against their Ally
| {{red|-25}}
|-
| Offensive War against their Ally
| {{red|-50}}
|-
| Enemy is Heir
| {{red|never}}
|-
| Enemy is Spouse
| {{red|never}}
|}
<section begin=AllyCallToWarCost/>
There is no cost to call on an ally to assist in a defensive war. However, there is a {{iconify|Prestige}} cost for offensive wars that is based on the ally's title rank:

{| class="mildtable" style="text-align: center;
! Title rank
! {{icon|prestige}} Cost
|-
| style="text-align: left; | {{icon|county}} Count || 75
|-
| style="text-align: left; | {{icon|duchy}} Duke || 150
|-
| style="text-align: left; | {{icon|kingdom}} King || 350
|-
| style="text-align: left; | {{icon|empire}} Emperor || 750
|}
<section end=AllyCallToWarCost/>
Allies declining to join an offensive war lose {{red|-20}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 5 years and {{icon|fame}} {{red|350}} Fame. Allies declining to join a defensive war lose {{red|-50}} {{iconify|Opinion}} for 25 years and {{icon|fame}} {{red|750}} Fame.

If a war lasts at least 2 years and one of the allies has 0% War Contribution, it will lose -20  Opinion with the war leader and have to pay  Gold or  Prestige or promise to earn War Contribution within a year. Breaking the promise will result in losing a Level of Fame as well as -50  Opinion with the war leader.

== Confederations ==
A confederation is an alliance of independent {{iconify|Count}}s or {{iconify|Duke}}s who automatically join each other's defensive wars but not offensive ones. Rulers in a confederation cannot attack or raid each other, cannot create new titles, and their authority laws are restricted to level 2. Confederation realms use the map color of the ruler who created the confederation.

Only {{iconify|Tribal}} or {{iconify|Nomadic}} rulers can create or join a confederation. {{iconify|Nomadic}} rulers in a confederation gain {{green|-25%}} {{iconify|County Fertility}} Consumption for 5 years and {{green|+30}} {{iconify|County Fertility}} in the county where their Nomadic Capital is located. The modifier is removed if the ruler leaves the confederation. They also automatically leave the confederation if they migrate.

Creating a confederation requires taking the Call for Confederation decision, which will unlock the character interaction to offer a neighbor to create a confederation. Acceptance can be increased by spending {{iconify|Prestige}} or {{iconify|Herd}} or using a hook and will decrease once the confederation has 3 members.

If two rulers have the same culture the acceptance is increased and the confederation will be named after their culture. Otherwise they will be named after the founder's de jure duchy.

=== Elevating confederations ===
Once a confederation has at least 5 members, the member with the highest level of fame can unite the confederation into a single {{iconify|Kingdom}}. In case of a tie in level of fame the option is not possible. The option to unify the confederation is available in both the confederation and decisions tabs. It also costs 150 {{iconify|Prestige}} and requires 25 {{iconify|Opinion}} or more with every member of the confederation. Unifying the confederation has the following effects:
* The character gains a {{iconify|Kingdom}} with the Confederation Elective title succession law. The title has no de jure lands until the confederation duchies are assimilated.
* All other confederation members become vassals.
* The character gains the [[File:Modifier travel safety positive.png|24px]] First King of the Confederation modifier for 15 years, which gives the following effects:
** {{icon|prestige}} {{green|+1}} Monthly Prestige
** {{icon|advantage}} {{green|+10}} Defender Advantage
** {{icon|legitimacy}} {{green|+20%}} Legitimacy Gain
** {{icon|gold}} {{green|-50%}} Men-at-Arms Recruitment Cost
** {{icon|opinion}} {{green|+20}} Vassal Opinion
** {{icon|herd}} {{green|+20%}} Herd Gain
** {{icon|gold}} {{red|+50%}} Title Creation Cost
* All counties belonging to confederation members gain the [[File:Modifier county fertility positive.png|24px]] Confederate Lands modifier for 30 years, which gives the following effects:
** {{icon|advantage}} {{green|+5}} Defender Advantage
** {{icon|control}} {{green|+0.3}} Monthly Control
** {{icon|county fertility}} {{green|+20%}} County Fertility Growth
* All vassals gain the [[File:Modifier wit positive.png|24px]] Vassal of the First King permanent modifier
