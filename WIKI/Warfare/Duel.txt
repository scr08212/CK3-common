{{Version|1.18}}
A duel is a combat outside of battle between two characters. Duels can last either until a character gets wounded or until death. Characters cannot duel if they are children, have the {{iconify|Blind}}, {{iconify|Incapable}} or {{iconify|Pregnant}} trait or are both over 70 and have below 10 {{iconify|Prowess}}. Characters will wear armor during duels, except for Tribal rulers who will fight shirtless.

== Issuing a challenge ==
Duels can start either as a result of events or if a character issues a challenge, which can only be done once every 5 years. If the recipient refuses the challenge they lose 150 {{iconify|Prestige}} while the challenger gains 150 {{iconify|Prestige}}. Acceptance for a duel is determined by the difference in {{iconify|Prowess}} as well as the recipient's {{iconify|Opinion}} and personality. AI rulers will never challenge someone with 15 {{iconify|Prowess}} more than them unless their Rationality is very low. There are seven types of Duels:

{{iconify|Accolade}}s on the winning side of a duel gain between {{green|+10}} and {{green|+250}} Glory, if the winner has a {{iconify|Prowess}} advantage between {{green|+4}} and {{red|-20}} or more, respectively. Defeating a {{iconify|Rival}} also leads to a {{green|+25}} Glory gain.

== Mechanics ==
Each duel has two values to keep track of:
* '''Likelihood of Success''' is a measure of who is currently dominating the duel. Most moves add Likelihood of Success, and the first character to get it a certain threshold above the opponent's wins.
* '''Risk of Injury''' is a measure of how overextended a character is. If at the end of a round the difference in Likelihood of Success is not high enough for a character to win each character has a chance to lose based on their Risk of Injury.

All duels last between 2 and 4 rounds. If after the fourth round there is no victor then the character with higher {{iconify|Prowess}} will win. During a duel either character can gain or lose Duel Edge. Duel Edge will add or substract {{iconify|Prowess}} to a character for the duration of the duel.

During each round both characters will choose one of three random combat moves that are given based on their {{iconify|Prowess}}. AI characters will choose among the available moves based on their personality:
* Characters with high Boldness or Vengefulness will choose the option that offers the best Likelihood of Success
* Characters with low Boldness or Vengefulness will choose the option that offers the least Risk of Injury
* Characters with high Rationality will choose the middle ground
* Characters without high or low Boldness, Vengefulness or Rationality will choose at random

=== Special moves ===
Special combat moves are either more effective or grant additional bonuses but have additional requirements. If those requirements are met special moves have a 30% chance to appear in the place of a regular move.
