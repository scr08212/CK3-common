{{Version|1.18}}
A casus belli, sometimes abbreviated CB and meaning "cause for war" in Latin, represents a justification for war that is recognized as legitimate by other characters. A ruler must have a valid casus belli in order to be able to declare war upon another ruler, can only gain from a war what the casus belli specifies, and the war is ended if the requirements for its casus belli are no longer met.

Each casus belli will cost either {{iconify|Prestige}} or {{iconify|Piety}}. If the attacker can't pay the cost, it can pay with a level of fame or devotion instead. Declaring war against a character's head of faith costs 500 {{iconify|Piety}} if the head of faith is spiritual and 100 {{iconify|Piety}} if they are temporal. Declaring war against a theocracy of the same faith additionally costs 100 {{iconify|Piety}}, stacking with the cost for attacking the head of faith. Casus belli costs can be removed via one of the game rules.

The war target is the map region which is targeted by a casus belli. If the casus belli does not target a map region then the defender's realm capital becomes the war target. The attacking side gains more war score by occupying holdings located in the war target region. After a grace period, the defender will passively gain war score by holding all counties in the war target region.

== Independence wars ==
Independence wars can be declared directly by {{iconify|Feudal}}, {{iconify|Clan}}, {{iconify|Tribal}}, {{iconify|Wanua}}, {{iconify|Nomadic}}, {{iconify|Mandala}}, {{iconify|Ritsuryō}} or {{iconify|Sōryō}} subjects, which costs 100 {{iconify|Prestige}} against a suzerain and 500 {{iconify|Prestige}} against a liege. Subjects with {{iconify|Tribal}} government pay only half of the cost. Independence wars are also declared between all faction members and the liege if the liege refuses the ultimatum of an Independence faction. During an independence war the attacker is still considered a subject of the defender but does not provide them with any income.
* If the war ends by enforcing demands, the attacker becomes independent.
* If the war ends by white peace, the attacker remains a subject. If they are a tributary their obligations are reduced.
* If the war ends by surrender, the attacker remains a subject. If they are a vassal the defender imprisons them and receives a title revocation reason. If they are a tributary their obligations and increased and the defender gains 20 {{iconify|Dread}}.

== Claims wars ==
The Claims casus belli can only be used against characters holding a title either you or one of your vassals or courtiers has a claim on. Guests must be invited to join your court (and become courtiers) in order to press their claim. Initially only one claimed title can be selected but multiple titles can be chosen with the {{iconify|Divine Right}} innovation or the second [[File:Heroic bloodline legacy track.png|24px]] Heroic Bloodline legacy for personal claims and {{iconify|Rightful Ownership}} innovation for vassal or courtier claims.
* If the war ends by enforcing demands, the claimant will gain the target titles. If they're a vassal or courtier, their liege will gain a {{iconify|weak hook}} on them and if they're a courtier they will become a vassal of their liege. If the claimant's new title rank is equal or higher than their liege's they will become independent.
* If the war ends by white peace, the defender keeps the target titles. Any {{iconify|Unpressed Claim}} contested in the war become {{iconify|Pressed Claim}}.
* If the war ends by surrender, the defender keeps the target title and the claims used for the casus belli are lost.
Declaring war over claims requires the following amount of {{iconify|Prestige}}:

== Conquest wars ==
If the attacked ruler has the same faith the casus belli costs {{iconify|Piety}}. If the attacked ruler has a different faith the casus belli costs {{iconify|Prestige}}.
* If the war ends by enforcing demands, the attacker will gain the target title and fame equal to the war contribution share.
* If the war ends by white peace, the defender keeps the target title and the attacker loses {{iconify|prestige||75-100|red}}.
* If the war ends by surrender, the defender keeps the target title, while the attacker pays the defender {{iconify|gold}} and gains {{red|+25}} faction discontent.
