Hired forces are predefined [[army|armies]] which may be temporarily controlled by hiring them with {{iconify|Gold}}. Hired forces cannot be used to [[raid]]. There are two types of hired forces, each one with its own tab in the Military menu.

== Mercenaries ==
[[File:Mercenaries screen.png|500px|thumb|right|The mercenaries screen.]]
Mercenaries are armies that can be hired by rulers for 3 years. The gold cost is paid upon hiring the Mercenaries and there is no additional cost associated with hiring them, but at the end of the 3 years, they will leave if their contract is not extended. Extending a contract for 3 years has the same cost as initially hiring the army. 

Each [[culture]] generates between one and three mercenary companies depending on the number of [[county|counties]] of that culture, with each additional company being bigger and more expensive than the previous one. They will pick a county of their culture as their headquarters and will be available to be hired by anyone with [[capital]] within [[diplomatic range]] of that county. Range between  Mercenary armies come with one or more specific [[men-at-arms]] regiments and will also contain a number of [[knight]]s. Mercenary regiments reinforce 3 times faster than regular regiments. Character can hire mercenaries of their own culture from further away.

Rulers are allowed to go into [[debt]] up to 2 years in order to hire mercenaries.

The cost of hiring mercenaries can be reduced by the following:

* 30% with the Soldiers of Lesser Fortune perk of the Overseer tree.
* 15% with the Communal court type.
* 15% with the "Swords for hire" Tradition, for same culture only.
* < 30% from the "Scoundrel" accolade stat
* 25% from the "Condottieri" regional innovation, for same culture only.
* 50% from "Malleable" subjects Tradition, for same culture only
* Many more...

== Holy orders ==
Holy orders are independent military organizations that work to defend and expand the influence of their faith. Each holy order has a {{iconify|Duke}} rank title.

Rulers can create a holy order via the [[Found Holy Order]] decision. The decision requires the ruler making the decision to choose an owned castle or city holding that aren't a county capital as the order's headquarters. The designated headquarters title is leased and may be revoked at any time by the title holder and revoking a grandmaster's last lease will destroy the holy order. When a holy order is created the ruler who created it will become its Patron and the order's grandmaster will belong to its faith and culture.

Rulers of a holy order's faith may hire them if they are at war with a [[faith]] considered Hostile or Evil, regardless of casus belli. A ruler may only have one holy order hired at a time. Hiring holy orders costs {{iconify|Piety}} unless the ruler is the order's Patron, scaling on the maximum amount of levies and regiments the holy order has. Holy orders remain hired for as long as their employer is at war with someone of another faith.

Holy orders have 500 {{iconify|Levies}}, 2 {{iconify|Knight}}s and 2 regiments. Each holding they own provides an additional regiment and 200 {{iconify|Levies}} and every two holdings they own provide an additional {{iconify|Knight}}. Their Men-at-Arms do not gain bonuses from the buildings in its holdings, but rather from their employer's buildings.

In 867 and 1066 there are no holy orders but in 1178 there are two starting holy orders for the {{iconify|Catholic}} faith in Jerusalem: Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller.

Holy orders select a name based on its religion, with some names shared among orders all faiths of the religion, and some faiths having unique names for their orders, as follows:

If an order is created, it will prioritize using a unique faith-based name, and once all unique names are used, it will start using a common name. Any orders created after all the above names are used, as well as orders for any faith not listed above, will be named “''Faith'' company of ''Location''”.

=== Patronage===
The first king or above upwards in the liege hierarchy of the holy order's headquarters is their patron. It is possible for a holy order to have no patron if no such ruler exists.

Patrons of a holy order may hire them at no cost, as long as they belong to the same faith. They may also take any leased holdings from the order. A Ruler that is a Patron of a holy order may get events that allows them to grant holdings to the new holy order. If a Patron takes a loan from the order and does not repay it, the Order may choose a holding it wants (usually a city) and demand that it be leased to them.

If a holy order is hired by another character, its Patron can repay their employer the {{iconify|Piety}} hiring cost to hire the holy order. This option is not available in multiplayer if the holy order is hired by another human player.

As Patron and not a Liege, the Holdings that the holy orders have leased will give neither {{icon|gold}} [[tax]]es nor {{icon|levies}} [[levy|levies]] to their Patron.

When you raise a holy order, they spawn at the oldest existing army assembly point in your realm.

===Members===
All members of a holy order, including its grandmaster, gain the {{iconify|Order Member}} trait. Rulers may also use the ''Ask to Join Holy Order'' interaction to send courtiers to a holy order, as long as the following conditions are met:
*Has none of the following traits: 
**{{iconify|Devoted}}
**{{iconify|Order Member}}
**{{iconify|Excommunicated}}
**{{iconify|Incapable}}
*Is not your Court Chaplain.
*The faith has a holy order whose leader is not a rival of the ruler
*Is adult
*Is not imprisoned
* The faith's View on Gender doctrine allows the prospective member's gender to serve as commanders or knights
*Has a martial education

If the courtier accepts, the ruler will lose 100 {{iconify|Piety}} while the courtier gains a level of devotion. If the faith has multiple holy orders the ruler will be asked which holy order to pick.

If the courtier is a close family of the requestor the courtier moves to holy order's court, but since ''Invite to Court'' interaction is available on all holy order's courtiers, the absent courtier can still be moved back to requestor's court upon request.

===Losing titles===
If a holy order's headquarters is lost, the holy order will select a new owned holding to fulfil the role, with a preference for holdings within the current patron's realm. However, if the holy order loses its last holding, it will be disbanded.
