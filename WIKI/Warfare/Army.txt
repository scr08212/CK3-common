[[File:Military tab.png|thumb|350px|The military tab with a regiment selected]]
An army is a large group of soldiers that can be controlled to attack other armies or siege a holding during wars. Hovering over an allied army will display its current orders.

After an army has completed half of a movement from one barony to another it becomes movement locked, meaning that it will not be able to stop or move to a different barony until it arrives at its destination.

Armies ordered to cross a sea zone will embark onto a fleet. Embarking costs {{iconify|Gold}} proportional to the army size. While embarked army maintenance is raised by {{red|+25%}}, and the army will start to lose supplies after 30 days at sea.

== Stats ==
Every unit has five important stats:
* {{iconify|Damage}}: Each point causes 0.03 damage during the battle phase.
* {{iconify|Toughness}}: Reduces losses caused by damage (both routed and killed). Each point allows taking 1 damage before losing all strength.
* {{iconify|Pursuit}}: Each point causes 0.17 damage during the retreat phase.
* {{iconify|Screen}}: Each point blocks 0.33 damage during the retreat phase.
* {{icon|levies}} Strength: Represents how many soldiers are in the unit and affects the total amount of stats. Heavy cavalry and asawira have 50 soldiers; elephant cavalry have 25 soldiers; siege weapons have 10 soldiers; all other men-at-arms have 100 soldiers. The number of soldiers for levies is their total amount. Men-at-arms can have their size increased for the same cost as recruiting them.

=== Damage dealing ===
The entire army's {{iconify|Damage}} is taken into account (which can be modified by Terrain, counters, etc), and then modified by a further {{green|+5%}} per {{iconify|Advantage}} for the side with more Advantage (this damage bonus per Advantage can be changed with a game rules setting). This is then modified by the [[Terrain]] width which is ((Enemy + Ally) Strength x (0.5 x Terrain width)). Therefore, a 1000 Levy army fighting a 500 Levy army on Plains will have the former Army fighting with the {{iconify|Damage}} of 750 Levies instead. This is further diminished if the Terrain is a mountain, applying a 0.5x Terrain Width modifier, making the total output equivalent of 625 Levies instead.

The total damage is then distributed unto the enemy army based upon their strength composition (i.e., an army composed of 8000 Levies, 1500 Archers, and 500 Spearmen would have 80% damage dealt to Levies, 15% to Archers, and 5% to Spearmen).

What this means is that Levies will usually take the most casualties since they generally make up the bulk of an army (more {{icon|levies}} Strength) and have low {{iconify|Toughness}}, and this damage will gradually move towards MAA as more and more Levies are defeated, finally moving unto Knights at last since they (usually) have the most {{iconify|Toughness}} and have the lowest {{icon|levies}} Strength. This is also why army qualities tend to 'upgrade' during battle as the composition of the (now-reduced) army has less low-ranking Levies filling it up.

== Rallying and Disbanding Armies ==
To raise an army, you must raise them at a "Rally Point". There is always one by default at the capital holding, but additional ones can be added at other holdings under your realm to a maximum of ten.

You can't raise armies where enemy armies are present. You also cannot disband armies when enemy armies are nearby (this generally means 1 county or an adjacent seazone away).

The army composition will be made up of:

* Individual Knights
* Regiments of MAA
* Levies from each holding you control
* Levies from each of your vassal that contributes

They can be divided and regrouped in different ways as you see fit by manually selecting the army and clicking on "Split Off New Army". "Split in Half" also allows to cut armies in roughly half proportions for convenience. You can also "Split off Hired or Special Soldiers" if you have any Mercenaries or Special Soldiers and use them for other purposes.

'Raider' armies cannot be divided if they are outside the realm you control.

Rallying armies will take a certain amount of time, and will take -5 Advantage if they are attacked while they are rallying. The amount of time it takes to raise all armies depends on the size/width of the realm, meaning that smaller sized realms will usually take a few days, while for continental-spanning Empires it may take months. MAA and knights will come by how close the rallying point is to the capital, while levies depend on what holdings they originate from.

It may be prudent to use "Raise Local Armies" if rallying all armies take too long and the local forces are enough to deal with the threat at hand; it could also be useful in the case of holding off an enemy until the main force fully arrives.

Armies can only be disbanded in friendly territory during wars.

If an army is disbanded while still at a distance from the capital or where they originate from, it will take them some time to get back and will incur a time penalty (usually months) before they could be rallied again. This can make sense to do to avoid paying maintenance costs while bringing them back, or the embarkation costs necessary to do so.

== Reinforcing Armies ==
Armies must be within friendly territory or disbanded to be reinforced; they will reinforce at the start of each month (although there appears to be a rather complex bug that forbids armies from reinforcing if they leave friendly territory and/or battle; disbanding armies should solve this issue).

Men-At-Arms reinforce themselves at a rate of 10% of the maximum capacity of their regiment per day with increased (3x?) cost, applied to each regiment individually.

Levies reinforce themselves based upon their Levy Reinforcement Rate; the base rate appears to be the same as the Garrison Reinforcement Rate, but it is modified by various factors such as the Martial skill of the ruler, whether the Martial is using "Organize Levies", and certain building upgrades. They are reinforced individually, based upon from which holding the levies originate.

== Quality ==
Based on its composition an army will be shown having a certain quality. This is a rough measure that allows player to see how skilled an army is, and will also determine the appearance of the army. For instance, an army composed entirely of levies would have the lowest quality, with the "army character" shown with peasant clothing. Conversely, an army composed of only Knights would be of the highest quality, with the "army character" shown in high-quality armor suits. A mixture of different units will create different levels of quality based on their proportion and type.

The quality of an army is important to note, since as a result of skill stat differences and 'Terrain Width' limitations, an outnumbered but skilled army can deal significantly more damage than one with a similar quality as their enemy. For example, it will take around 3.3x as much {{icon|levies}} Levies to take down an Armored Footman regiment {{icon|Heavy Infantry}}(without being stationed) when fighting in Plains.

== Commander ==
Each army can have one Commander: a character who commands the army and uses their {{iconify|Martial}} skill to improve an army's {{iconify|Advantage}}. There are many different [[Traits#Commander_traits|Commander traits]] available, which have a direct effect on battles and/or give the Commander bonuses outside of battles. A commander can be any [[Vassals|Vassal]] (unless they are in a civil war) or [[Courtiers|Courtier]] who is allowed to be so by Martial Custom.

Commanders, like Knights, are also prone to be injured, maimed, and killed during battle. The chance of being harmed depends on the {{iconify|Prowess}} skill of the commander, with higher prowess decreasing the chance. The chance is also reduced if the commander's army outnumbers the enemy or the game difficulty was reduced.

Each month a commander has a very low chance to die if their {{iconify|Health}} is not high enough, and the commander doesn't have the commander trait for the current terrain. If an army loses a Battle, there is a 10% chance for its commander to be captured and imprisoned.

== Knights ==
{{main|Knight}}
Knights are "elites" that fight in an army; unlike other fighters, they are [[Characters]] assigned to combat.

== Basic soldiers ==
Basic soldiers are conscripted peasants with limited training that make up the bulk of armies. They are not very impressive on their own, but they are cheap, requiring no cost to maintain or reinforce, and are used in great numbers to complement more important troops and outnumber defenders in a siege or raid. They become available in increasingly large numbers and reinforce significantly faster than men-at-arms.
* {{iconify|Levies}} are used by all governments except Nomadic and Adventurer. Their numbers are determined by the holdings of the ruler's domain, as well as any that are given by their vassals and Realm Priest. A Levy has 10 {{iconify|Damage}} and 10 {{iconify|Toughness}} and a monthly cost of 3 {{iconify|Gold}} per 1,000 when raised. Levies don't tend to increase much in stats with Eras and are fairly static.
* {{iconify|Horde Riders}} are used by Nomadic governments. The base rate of Horde Riders conversion is 15% of a Ruler's {{iconify|Herd}}, which consumes the equivalent amount of Herd, but this can be increased by various factors.  {{iconify|Herd}} can also be converted into men-at-arms regiments. If the government switches to something else, the Horde Riders will become special soldiers. A Horde Rider has 12 {{iconify|Damage}}, 12 {{iconify|Toughness}}, 10 {{iconify|Pursuit}}, 15 {{iconify|Screen}} and does not cost maintenance when raised.

== Men-at-Arms ==
Men-at-Arms are trained troops that come in several different Regiment types which excel in their given role, all with their own stats and uses. 

Each type of Men-at-Arms will counter at least one other type, reducing their {{iconify|Damage}} proportional to the size difference of the countering Men-at-Arms (-45% in 1:1, a max of -90% in 2:1, in certain cases can have effectiveness modified as 2x or 0.5x, resulting in -90% and -22.5% at 1:1, respectively). During battle countered Men-at-Arms will glow red, countering Men-at-Arms will glow green and Men-at-Arms that are countering and being countered at the same time will glow yellow.

Men-at-Arms regiments are reinforced at a rate of 10% of their maximum size per month. The reinforcement can be canceled manually by toggling off the "Monthly Reinforcement" at the bottom of "Military" tab in case the economy cannot support it.

Although there are a few exceptions, the Men-At-Arms counter runs similar to a slightly expanded Rock-Paper-Scissors, resulting in a circle of counters. The counter is generally as following:

{{iconify|Skirmishers}} > {{iconify|Heavy Infantry}} > {{iconify|Spearmen}} > {{icon|Light Cavalry}}{{icon|Heavy Cavalry}} Cavalry > {{iconify|Archers}} > {{iconify|Skirmishers}} 

There are also a few unique cases of MAA such as {{icon|Horse Archers}} Archer Cavalry, {{iconify|Camel Cavalry}} and {{iconify|Elephant Cavalry}}. They will be explicitly countered if the unit type says so.

Most of the Men-at-Arms types have a favorable and unfavorable terrain. These bonuses and penalties are specific and can be seen in game at the Men-at-Arms regiment management window by hovering over terrain icons. The modifiers are constant and not percentage based.

Each Ruler has a limited number and size of Regiments for Men-at-Arms, but existing Regiments may be upgraded to increase their size. Regiments can also be downsized to lower the monthly maintenance or destroyed, but the cost is not refunded. Men-at-Arms Regiments are inherited by the primary heir regardless of succession law, but if the heir already has their own Regiments, they will not inherit more than what their limit allows.

The base limit is 2 (Count) regiments with a maximum size of 3, but plenty of modifiers may increase the limit. The two most notable examples are the [[Innovation|Innovations]] of each Era, which increase the regiment amount by 1 each, and the size by a further 2/3/4/5 depending on the Era. As well as ascending to a [[Titles|Duke/King/Emperor]] which give 1/2/3 more regiments compared to a Count. Regiments cannot be recruited above the limit. If the limit is reduced existing regiments are not destroyed but each regiment above the limit will increase maintenance cost by 20%.

Most governments pay for Men-at-Arms with {{iconify|Gold}}. Tribal and Wanua rulers pay twice more with {{iconify|Prestige}} to create a regiment but 30% less for maintenance. Nomadic rulers must also pay {{iconify|Herd}} equal to the regiment size if the MAA is upgradable from the horde, otherwise the cost is paid fully in gold. All Men-at-Arms except Elephants and House Guards triple their maintenance cost when raised, they also cost the same amount of money to reinforce. Men-at-Arms also increase the {{iconify|Provisions}} cost for an adventurer to move its Camp. Note that there are multiple modifiers that can reduce the cost of increasing, reinforcing, maintaining, or leading an army.

Men-at-Arms Regiments can be stationed in a holding from the Domain. Depending on the buildings constructed in the holding, stationing Men-at-Arms may increase their stats.

The default regiment size is 100. All Heavy Cavalry have a regiment size of 50. Ballistrai, Ayrudzi, Asawira, Kheshig and Heavy Horse Archers have a regiment size of 50. War Elephants have a regiment size of 25.

=== Siege weapons ===
Siege weapons are regiments that cannot fight in battle, but will greatly increase Siege Progress when attacking holdings. Note that the Daily Siege Progress refers to the total effect of one regiment size and will be increased if the regiment increases in size and decreased if the regiment is damaged. There are two sets of siege weapons depending on the culture's heritage but the stats are identical.

== Supply ==
Supply reflects whether armies are properly provided with food and other necessities. Armies carry supplies with them as they move around the map. All armies can carry at least 100 units of Supply, although armies commanded by a commander with the Living Off the Land perk can carry up to 300 supply. When they are raised, they start with 100 Supply. Supply is consumed once per month whenever armies are in a Barony with a lower Supply Limit than the army size and gained whenever armies are in owned, occupied or allied territory up to the current Barony's Supply Limit. Low Supply will apply penalties to [[Warfare#The_advantage_modifier|Advantage]] in battles. If an army runs out of Supply entirely, it will receive a bigger Advantage penalty and also take Attrition damage every month.

=== Supply limit ===
The base supply limit of a barony is 2000. The minimum supply limit of a barony is 1000. {{#lst:County|DevelopmentSupplyLimit}} Coastal baronies have their supply limit increased by {{green|+25%}}. A barony's supply limit can also be affected by its terrain.

== Attrition==
Attrition is a loss of Levies and Men-at-Arms that is caused by various factors:
* Besieging and Raiding armies suffer {{red|1%}} attrition per month.
* Armies that have completely run out of supplies suffer {{red|5%}} attrition per month.
* Moving from one hostile (unoccupied) County into another hostile County instantly causes the army to lose {{red|5%}} of their troops (minimum of 100) as long as the destination County is not adjacent to any allied County. Raiding armies next to major rivers as well as nomad armies within the steppe regions are exempt. The {{icon|Reaver}} Reaver trait reduces this by {{green|75%}} (minimum of 25).

==Special soldiers ==
Special soldiers are maintenance free armies that are created by decisions or certain historical rulers and do not reinforce.
