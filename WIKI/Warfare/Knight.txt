{{Version|1.17}}
Knights are characters that fight in an army. Each ruler can only have a small number of Knights. By default, Knights are appointed automatically based on their {{iconify|Prowess}} skill, but characters can be manually forced or forbidden to become Knights. Diarchs cannot be appointed as knights.

If an army loses a Battle, each Knight has a 10% chance to be captured and imprisoned and 5% chance to be killed. The chances are increased to 55.3% and 27.6% respectively if the army is defeated in the Early Battle Phase.

== Cultural alternatives ==
Knight is the default naming for most governments, and Champion for tribal governments. But some alternatives exist.

== Appointment ==
Each ruler can only have a small number of Knights. By default, Knights are appointed automatically based on their {{iconify|Prowess}} skill, but characters can be manually forced or forbidden to become Knights.

To be appointed as Knights a character must fulfil the following conditions:
* Is adult
* Is not imprisoned
* Is not diarch
* Does not have the {{iconify|Blind}} or {{iconify|Incapable}} trait
* Members of the clergy and characters with the {{iconify|Devoted}} trait may only serve as knights if their faith has the {{icon|Clerical function}} ''Recruitment'' Clerical Function doctrine, the Warmonger tenet, or the Unrelenting Faith tenet.
* If {{iconify|Royal Court}} is installed the ruler's culture's Martial Custom must allow it.
* If {{iconify|Royal Court}} is not installed the ruler's faith's View on Gender must allow it.

== Combat performance ==

Knights represent a significant fraction of the total realm fighting force. Their strong side is extremely high damage per combat width, which helps to out-damage and even stackwipe larger enemy armies. They are also free in terms of monthly maintenance. Their weakness is low total toughness, requiring the use of MAA or levies to absorb damage for them, and the potential to get wounded, killed or captured in combat.

Knights can be wounded, maimed (one-eyed, one-legged, disfigured, maimed, incapable), killed and captured. The chance of being wounded and killed decreases with higher levels of {{iconify|Prowess}} or if their army outnumbers the enemy's or the game difficulty was reduced. Knights with Berserker traits may instantly kill other knights if they are lower than 80% of the Berserker knight's Prowess.

Knights combat stats are based on their {{iconify|Prowess}} skill with each point of {{iconify|Prowess}} grants 50 {{iconify|Damage}} and 10 {{iconify|Toughness}}, further modified by realm Knight Effectiveness.

To put these numbers into perspective, one levy soldier has 10 {{iconify|Damage}} and 10 {{iconify|Toughness}}, and so 1 knight with 10 prowess and base effectiveness deals as much damage as 50 levies. For an early game tribal realm it is not uncommon to field 7 knights with 15 average prowess and 120% effectiveness, which amounts to as much damage as 630 levies.

== Number of Knights ==

Each ruler can only have a small number of Knights. This number can be increased from various sources.

== Accolades ==
[[File:El Cid Accolade.png|thumb|300px|An accolade]]
{{expansion|tnt}}
{{iconify|Accolade}}s are special named honors granted to knights, Acclaimed Knights, by rulers at the cost of 200 {{iconify|Prestige}} that enables the accolade to gain Glory. These Acclaimed Knights can only be unlanded knights with at least 8 {{iconify|Prowess}} and have a {{green|+15}} {{iconify|Opinion}} of their liege.

If the Acclaimed Knight ever leaves, then a new knight may succeed them and take up the accolade. Rulers can choose an accolade successor, that at a minimum, meets the primary accolade attribute requirements. If there is no accolade successor available then the accolade will become inactive until a replacement character is recruited to court. 

If there are no successors available at the rulers court, then a ruler can pay 125 {{iconify|Prestige}} to "Seek Worthy Accolade Successor", a few days later a replacement joins the rulers court that, at a minimum, meets the primary accolade attribute requirements. This "Seek Worthy Accolade Successor" has a 2 year cool down period for the ruler. 

A ruler can have up to 5 accolades, depending on the following:
* {{iconify|King}} title rank 
* {{iconify|Emperor}} title rank
* {{icon|hegemony}} Hegemon title rank
* {{iconify|Bannus}} innovation
* {{iconify|Knighthood}} innovation
* [[File:Glory legacy track.png|24px]] Glory dynasty legacy 2

=== Glory gain ===
{{iconify|Accolade}}s can gain Glory if:
* Their army is victorious. (+30 Glory for each battle present)
* They win against other knights.
* They attend activities. (Confirmed: Grand tournaments, Grand Weddings, Grand Tour, Hunting) [Activities that do NOT provide glory: Funeral]
* Their liege wins a war against a ruler with higher title rank. 

Once enough Glory has been obtained the accolade will rank up and gain additional bonuses. 

There are 6 ranks for accolades which require the following amount of Glory:
{| class="wikitable plainlist"
! Rank
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
|-
! Glory
| 100 || 300 || 600 || 1000 || 1500 || 2100
|}
There is no maximum limit of glory.

=== Glory loss ===
{{iconify|Accolade}}s lose Glory upon succession of the Accolade. This happens if the Acclaimed Knight:

*dies.
* leaves your court.

The amount of glory lost will be more if the successor doesn’t meet the secondary accolade attribute requirements of the preceding Acclaimed Knight.  This new Acclaimed Knight will then adopt a secondary accolade attribute that better suits their personality.

Typically, if both primary and secondary accolade attribute are met by the successor, then a percentage loss of glory is lost, exampled here as when an Accolade was near level 6 with 2100+ glory and then succeeded, approximately 320 glory is lost. If only the primary accolade attribute is met by the successor, then approximately 540 glory is lost on succession. 

=== {{iconify|Accolade}} attributes ===
Each accolade has two accolade attributes available for selection depending on the knight's traits. The primary accolade attribute determines the bonuses received at levels 1-3-5 and the secondary accolade attribute determines the bonuses received at levels 2-4-6. Only one of each Accolade Attributes may be selected for Accolades.
